The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n  * A present with dimensions `2x3x4` requires `2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52` square feet of wrapping paper plus `6` square feet of slack, for a total of `58` square feet.\\n  * A present with dimensions `1x1x10` requires `2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42` square feet of wrapping paper plus `1` square foot of slack, for a total of `43` square feet.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll numbers in the elves\\' list are in feet.

Corporate policy dictates that passwords must be exactly eight lowercase letters (for security reasons), so he finds his new password by _incrementing_ his old password string repeatedly until it is valid.\\n\\nIncrementing is just like counting with numbers: `xx`, `xy`, `xz`, `ya`, `yb`, and so on. Increase the rightmost letter one step; if it was `z`, it wraps around to `a`, and repeat with the next letter to the left until one doesn\\'t wrap around.\\n\\nUnfortunately for Santa, a new Security-Elf recently started, and he has imposed some additional password requirements:\\n\\n  * Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like `abc`, `bcd`, `cde`, and so on, up to `xyz`. They cannot skip letters; `abd` doesn\\'t count.\\n  * Passwords may not contain the letters `i`, `o`, or `l`, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.\\n  * Passwords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like `aa`, `bb`, or `zz`.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n  * `hijklmmn` meets the first requirement (because it contains the straight `hij`) but fails the second requirement requirement (because it contains `i` and `l`).\\n  * `abbceffg` meets the third requirement (because it repeats `bb` and `ff`) but fails the first requirement.\\n  * `abbcegjk` fails the third requirement, because it only has one double letter (`bb`).\\n  * The next password after `abcdefgh` is `abcdffaa`.\\n  * The next password after `ghijklmn` is `ghjaabcc`, because you eventually skip all the passwords that start with `ghi...`, since `i` is not allowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven Santa\\'s current password (your puzzle input), what should his _next password_ be?\\n'\u001b[0m\n",
