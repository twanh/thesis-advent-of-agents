After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.\\n\\nThe Elves don\\'t want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.\\n\\nThey do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:\\n\\n    [D]    \\n[N] [C]    \\n[Z] [M] [P]\\n 1   2   3 \\n\\nmove 1 from 2 to 1\\nmove 3 from 1 to 3\\nmove 2 from 2 to 1\\nmove 1 from 1 to 2\\nIn this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.\\n\\nThen, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:\\n\\n[D]        \\n[N] [C]    \\n[Z] [M] [P]\\n 1   2   3 \\nIn the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:\\n\\n        [Z]\\n        [N]\\n    [C] [D]\\n    [M] [P]\\n 1   2   3\\nThen, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved one at a time, crate C ends up below crate M:\\n\\n        [Z]\\n        [N]\\n[M]     [D]\\n[C]     [P]\\n 1   2   3\\nFinally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:\\n\\n        [Z]\\n        [N]\\n        [D]\\n[C] [M] [P]\\n 1   2   3\\nThe Elves just need to know which crate will end up on top of each stack; in this example, the top crates are C in stack 1, M in stack 2, and Z in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message CMZ.\\n\\nAfter the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?\\n\\n\\n\\nYour output MUST be a valid JSON object.

The ground is rumbling almost continuously now, but the strange valves bought you some time. It\\'s definitely getting warmer in here, though.\\n\\nThe tunnels eventually open into a very tall, narrow chamber. Large, oddly-shaped rocks are falling into the chamber from above, presumably due to all the rumbling. If you can\\'t work out where the rocks will fall next, you might be crushed!\\n\\nThe five types of rocks have the following peculiar shapes, where # is rock and . is empty space:\\n\\n####\\n\\n.#.\\n###\\n.#.\\n\\n..#\\n..#\\n###\\n\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\n##\\n##\\nThe rocks fall in the order shown above: first the - shape, then the + shape, and so on. Once the end of the list is reached, the same order repeats: the - shape falls first, sixth, 11th, 16th, etc.\\n\\nThe rocks don\\'t spin, but they do get pushed around by jets of hot gas coming out of the walls themselves. A quick scan reveals the effect the jets of hot gas will have on the rocks as they fall (your puzzle input).\\n\\nFor example, suppose this was the jet pattern in your cave:\\n\\n>>><<><>><<<>><>>><<<>>><<<><<<>><>><<>>\\nIn jet patterns, < means a push to the left, while > means a push to the right. The pattern above means that the jets will push a falling rock right, then right, then right, then left, then left, then right, and so on. If the end of the list is reached, it repeats.\\n\\nThe tall, vertical chamber is exactly seven units wide. Each rock appears so that its left edge is two units away from the left wall and its bottom edge is three units above the highest rock in the room (or the floor, if there isn\\'t one).\\n\\nAfter a rock appears, it alternates between being pushed by a jet of hot gas one unit (in the direction indicated by the next symbol in the jet pattern) and then falling one unit down. If any movement would cause any part of the rock to move into the walls, floor, or a stopped rock, the movement instead does not occur. If a downward movement would have caused a falling rock to move into the floor or an already-fallen rock, the falling rock stops where it is (having landed on something) and a new rock immediately begins falling.\\n\\nDrawing falling rocks with @ and stopped rocks with #, the jet pattern in the example above manifests as follows:\\n\\nThe first rock begins falling:\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right, but nothing happens:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right, but nothing happens:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@@@@.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit, causing it to come to rest:\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nA new rock begins falling:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit, causing it to come to rest:\\n|...#...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nA new rock begins falling:\\n|....@..|\\n|....@..|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|...#...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\nThe moment each of the next few rocks begins falling, you would see this:\\n\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..#....|\\n|..#....|\\n|####...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@...|\\n|..@@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|....@..|\\n|....@..|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..#....|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.....#.|\\n|.....#.|\\n|..####.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@...|\\n|..@@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|....#..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|..####.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|....#..|\\n|....##.|\\n|##..##.|\\n|######.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\nTo prove to the elephants your simulation is accurate, they want to know how tall the tower will get after 2022 rocks have stopped (but before the 2023rd rock begins falling).

Your task is to process the following Advent of Code puzzle description so that the output can be stored in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) database and later used by a planning agent. Follow these steps precisely:\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 1: Detailed Extraction\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nExtract every technical detail from the puzzle and separate it from the narrative. Specifically, please extract:\\n  • Core Problem Statement:\\n      - A concise description of the computational task (exclude story or decorative language).\\n  • Input Specifications:\\n      - Detailed descriptions of the expected input format, data types, ranges, and constraints.\\n  • Output Specifications:\\n      - Clear requirements on what the solution must produce (format, limits, etc.).\\n  • Sample/Test Cases:\\n      - Any example inputs and their corresponding outputs.\\n  • Additional Technical Constraints:\\n      - Any extra conditions, edge cases, or ambiguous instructions that might affect the solution.\\n\\nAlso, extract all narrative or stylistic elements (background story, flavor text, etc.) into a separate collection called “Supplementary Narrative.”\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 2: Metadata Tagging for RAG\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nBased on the technical extraction, generate relevant metadata tags or keywords to index this puzzle in the database. Include at least:\\n  • Domain Tags (e.g., \"string manipulation\", \"graph traversal\", \"grid simulation\").\\n  • Problem Type or Algorithm Hints (e.g., \"backtracking\", \"dynamic programming\", \"parsing\").\\n  • Any other unique identifiers or categorizations that seem appropriate (e.g., \"recursive\", \"optimization\").\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 3: Synthesis for Downstream Planning\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nUsing the extracted technical details:\\n  • Create a “Planning-Ready Core” section that synthesizes and rewords the above information into a concise, self-contained technical summary. This summary must include all essential details (problem statement, inputs, outputs, and constraints) but exclude distracting narrative elements.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 4: Structured Output Format\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nReturn your final answer using the exact following structure:\\n\\n----------------------------\\n[Section A: Full Extraction with Metadata]\\n- **Core Problem Statement:**  \\n  (Your detailed technical description of the problem here.)\\n- **Input Specifications:**  \\n  (Describe the input format, types, constraints, etc.)\\n- **Output Specifications:**  \\n  (Describe what the solution should output.)\\n- **Sample/Test Cases:**  \\n  (List any examples, including inputs and expected outputs.)\\n- **Additional Technical Constraints:**  \\n  (Detail any edge cases, special conditions, or ambiguous instructions.)\\n- **Metadata Tags:**  \\n  (Provide a list of domain tags, problem type keywords, and any additional categorization.)\\n\\n----------------------------\\n[Section B: Planning-Ready Core]\\n- (Provide a concise, synthesized technical summary that a planning agent can use without reference to any narrative details.)\\n\\n----------------------------\\n[Section C: Supplementary Narrative]\\n- (Include all narrative, flavor text, and stylistic commentary from the original puzzle description, along with any potential technical hints embedded within.)\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nPlease ensure that each section is clearly labeled and that your output is structured, complete, and ready for both retrieval and downstream planning.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe puzzle is:\\n\\n\" Your handheld device has located an alternative exit from the cave for you and the elephants. The ground is rumbling almost continuously now, but the strange valves bought you some time. It\\'s definitely getting warmer in here, though.\\n\\nThe tunnels eventually open into a very tall, narrow chamber. Large, oddly-shaped rocks are falling into the chamber from above, presumably due to all the rumbling. If you can\\'t work out where the rocks will fall next, you might be crushed!\\n\\nThe five types of rocks have the following peculiar shapes, where # is rock and . is empty space:\\n\\n####\\n\\n.#.\\n###\\n.#.\\n\\n..#\\n..#\\n###\\n\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\n##\\n##\\nThe rocks fall in the order shown above: first the - shape, then the + shape, and so on. Once the end of the list is reached, the same order repeats: the - shape falls first, sixth, 11th, 16th, etc.\\n\\nThe rocks don\\'t spin, but they do get pushed around by jets of hot gas coming out of the walls themselves. A quick scan reveals the effect the jets of hot gas will have on the rocks as they fall (your puzzle input).\\n\\nFor example, suppose this was the jet pattern in your cave:\\n\\n>>><<><>><<<>><>>><<<>>><<<><<<>><>><<>>\\nIn jet patterns, < means a push to the left, while > means a push to the right. The pattern above means that the jets will push a falling rock right, then right, then right, then left, then left, then right, and so on. If the end of the list is reached, it repeats.\\n\\nThe tall, vertical chamber is exactly seven units wide. Each rock appears so that its left edge is two units away from the left wall and its bottom edge is three units above the highest rock in the room (or the floor, if there isn\\'t one).\\n\\nAfter a rock appears, it alternates between being pushed by a jet of hot gas one unit (in the direction indicated by the next symbol in the jet pattern) and then falling one unit down. If any movement would cause any part of the rock to move into the walls, floor, or a stopped rock, the movement instead does not occur. If a downward movement would have caused a falling rock to move into the floor or an already-fallen rock, the falling rock stops where it is (having landed on something) and a new rock immediately begins falling.\\n\\nDrawing falling rocks with @ and stopped rocks with #, the jet pattern in the example above manifests as follows:\\n\\nThe first rock begins falling:\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right, but nothing happens:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right, but nothing happens:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@@@@.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit, causing it to come to rest:\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nA new rock begins falling:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit, causing it to come to rest:\\n|...#...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nA new rock begins falling:\\n|....@..|\\n|....@..|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|...#...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\nThe moment each of the next few rocks begins falling, you would see this:\\n\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..#....|\\n|..#....|\\n|####...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@...|\\n|..@@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|....@..|\\n|....@..|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..#....|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.....#.|\\n|.....#.|\\n|..####.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@...|\\n|..@@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|....#..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|..####.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|....#..|\\n|....##.|\\n|##..##.|\\n|######.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\nTo prove to the elephants your simulation is accurate, they want to know how tall the tower will get after 2022 rocks have stopped (but before the 2023rd rock begins falling).

The ground is rumbling almost continuously now, but the strange valves bought you some time. It\\'s definitely getting warmer in here, though.\\n\\nThe tunnels eventually open into a very tall, narrow chamber. Large, oddly-shaped rocks are falling into the chamber from above, presumably due to all the rumbling. If you can\\'t work out where the rocks will fall next, you might be crushed!\\n\\nThe five types of rocks have the following peculiar shapes, where # is rock and . is empty space:\\n\\n####\\n\\n.#.\\n###\\n.#.\\n\\n..#\\n..#\\n###\\n\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\n##\\n##\\nThe rocks fall in the order shown above: first the - shape, then the + shape, and so on. Once the end of the list is reached, the same order repeats: the - shape falls first, sixth, 11th, 16th, etc.\\n\\nThe rocks don\\'t spin, but they do get pushed around by jets of hot gas coming out of the walls themselves. A quick scan reveals the effect the jets of hot gas will have on the rocks as they fall (your puzzle input).\\n\\nFor example, suppose this was the jet pattern in your cave:\\n\\n>>><<><>><<<>><>>><<<>>><<<><<<>><>><<>>\\nIn jet patterns, < means a push to the left, while > means a push to the right. The pattern above means that the jets will push a falling rock right, then right, then right, then left, then left, then right, and so on. If the end of the list is reached, it repeats.\\n\\nThe tall, vertical chamber is exactly seven units wide. Each rock appears so that its left edge is two units away from the left wall and its bottom edge is three units above the highest rock in the room (or the floor, if there isn\\'t one).\\n\\nAfter a rock appears, it alternates between being pushed by a jet of hot gas one unit (in the direction indicated by the next symbol in the jet pattern) and then falling one unit down. If any movement would cause any part of the rock to move into the walls, floor, or a stopped rock, the movement instead does not occur. If a downward movement would have caused a falling rock to move into the floor or an already-fallen rock, the falling rock stops where it is (having landed on something) and a new rock immediately begins falling.\\n\\nDrawing falling rocks with @ and stopped rocks with #, the jet pattern in the example above manifests as follows:\\n\\nThe first rock begins falling:\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right, but nothing happens:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right, but nothing happens:\\n|...@@@@|\\n|.......|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@@@@|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@@@@.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit, causing it to come to rest:\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nA new rock begins falling:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit:\\n|..@....|\\n|.@@@...|\\n|..@....|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nRock falls 1 unit, causing it to come to rest:\\n|...#...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\nA new rock begins falling:\\n|....@..|\\n|....@..|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|...#...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\nThe moment each of the next few rocks begins falling, you would see this:\\n\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..#....|\\n|..#....|\\n|####...|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@...|\\n|..@@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|...@...|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|...@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|....@..|\\n|....@..|\\n|..@@@..|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|..#....|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|..@....|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.....#.|\\n|.....#.|\\n|..####.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@...|\\n|..@@...|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|....#..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|..####.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\n\\n|..@@@@.|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|.......|\\n|....#..|\\n|....#..|\\n|....##.|\\n|##..##.|\\n|######.|\\n|.###...|\\n|..#....|\\n|.####..|\\n|....##.|\\n|....##.|\\n|....#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|..#.#..|\\n|#####..|\\n|..###..|\\n|...#...|\\n|..####.|\\n+-------+\\nTo prove to the elephants your simulation is accurate, they want to know how tall the tower will get after 2022 rocks have stopped (but before the 2023rd rock begins falling).
