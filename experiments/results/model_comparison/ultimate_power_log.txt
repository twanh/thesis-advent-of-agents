Overall Approach\nRead both lists from the puzzle input, sort them independently in ascending order, then walk the two sorted lists in parallel and accumulate the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `list[int] left` – stores all integers appearing in the “left” column of the input.  \n* `list[int] right` – stores all integers appearing in the “right” column of the input.  \nThese simple Python lists suffice because we only need random–access sorting and sequential traversal.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**  \n  * **Objective:** Extract two equally-long integer lists from the raw input.  \n  * **Input:** Multiline string from `stdin` (or file) – each non-empty line contains one or more integer tokens.  \n  * **Output:** `left`, `right` lists of equal length.  \n  * **Techniques:**  \n    * Strip trailing newline characters, ignore blank lines.  \n    * Split each non-empty line on whitespace.  \n    * Handle two possible formats seamlessly:  \n      1. Two integers per line → first token ⇒ `left`, second ⇒ `right`.  \n      2. One integer per line with a blank line separating the two lists.  \n         * Accumulate into a temporary list; when a blank line is reached, switch to filling the second list.  \n    * Validate that final lengths match; raise descriptive error otherwise.  \n  * **Constraints/Rules:** Numbers are positive (but parse with `int()` for generality). Ensure `O(N)` memory/time for parsing.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Sort Each List**  \n  * **Objective:** Prepare each list for element-wise pairing by rank.  \n  * **Input:** `left`, `right`.  \n  * **Output:** `left_sorted`, `right_sorted` (may reuse originals).  \n  * **Techniques:** Call Python’s in-place `list.sort()` (`Timsort`, `O(N log N)`).  \n  * **Constraints/Rules:** Works correctly with duplicate values and any integer magnitude.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Pairwise Distance Accumulation**  \n  * **Objective:** Compute the total distance as defined by the puzzle.  \n  * **Input:** `left_sorted`, `right_sorted`.  \n  * **Output:** Single integer `total_distance`.  \n  * **Techniques:**  \n    * Iterate index `i` from `0` to `N-1`.  \n    * `total_distance += abs(left_sorted[i] - right_sorted[i])`.  \n  * **Constraints/Rules:** Use 64-bit (`int`) arithmetic; Python handles big ints automatically.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Generate Output**  \n  * **Objective:** Present the solution in the exact format required by Advent of Code.  \n  * **Input:** `total_distance`.  \n  * **Output:** Single line printed to `stdout` containing `total_distance`.  \n  * **Details:** No additional spaces, prefixes, or text.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Splitting and casting strings to integers.\n* Timsort (`list.sort`) – stable, `O(N log N)`.\n* Sequential scan with absolute difference – `O(N)`.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Empty input or mismatched list lengths → raise/print descriptive error.\n* Duplicate numbers in either list.\n* Very large lists (ensure algorithmic complexity: parsing + sort is dominant).\n* Very large integer values (Python handles natively).\n* Extraneous blank lines at beginning/end of file → ignore safely.\n* Trailing spaces / tabs → handled by `str.split()`.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single line containing one integer – the total distance between the two lists, e.g.:\n\n```\n11\n```\n\nNo additional characters or formatting.'

Overall Approach\nRead both lists, sort each independently in ascending order, then iterate position‐by‐position to accumulate the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `list_left: list[int]` – raw and then sorted location IDs from the left column.  \n* `list_right: list[int]` – raw and then sorted location IDs from the right column.  \nThese native Python lists are ideal because they support in-place `sort()` and O(1) indexed access, both of which we need.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Convert the raw puzzle input into two integer lists.\n  * Input: Multiline string from `stdin` where each non-blank line contains two integers (left and right) separated by whitespace.\n  * Output: `list_left`, `list_right`\n  * Details:\n    1. Iterate through `sys.stdin` line by line.\n    2. Strip the line; skip if it is empty.\n    3. Split by whitespace → expect exactly two tokens. Convert to `int`.\n    4. Append the first integer to `list_left`, the second to `list_right`.\n    5. (Optional) After reading, assert `len(list_left) == len(list_right)` to guard against malformed input.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Sort Lists**\n  * Description: Prepare lists for optimal pairing by sorting.\n  * Input: `list_left`, `list_right`\n  * Output: `list_left_sorted`, `list_right_sorted` (may be the same objects after in-place sort)\n  * Details: Call `list_left.sort()` and `list_right.sort()`.  \n    Python’s Timsort handles duplicates and already-sorted data efficiently.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Accumulate Pairwise Distances**\n  * Description: Compute the total distance between all pairs.\n  * Input: The two sorted lists.\n  * Output: `total_distance: int`\n  * Details:\n    1. Initialize `total_distance = 0`.\n    2. Loop over index `i` from `0` to `len(list_left) - 1`.\n    3. Add `abs(list_left[i] - list_right[i])` to `total_distance`.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print the answer exactly as required.\n  * Input: `total_distance`\n  * Output: Single line containing the numeric result.\n  * Details: Use `print(total_distance)`. No extra formatting or text.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Sorting (Python’s built-in Timsort, O(n log n)).\n* Simple iteration and arithmetic for absolute differences (`abs`).\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Lists are guaranteed equal length, but add an assertion for safety.\n* Duplicate numbers are fine – sorting preserves multiplicities.\n* Minimum size (empty input) → output should be `0`.\n* Very large lists: O(n log n) sorting dominates; memory usage is O(n), well within typical limits for AoC inputs.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer printed to `stdout`, representing the total distance (sum of absolute differences) between the two sorted lists.'

Overall Approach\nScan the corrupted memory string with a regular expression that matches exactly the pattern `mul(X,Y)` where `X` and `Y` are integers from 1 to 999 (1–3 digits, no embedded whitespace).  \nFor every match, convert the captured numbers to integers, compute their product, and keep a running sum.  \nFinally, output the accumulated sum.\n\n## 2.

Detailed Steps\n\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Read the entire puzzle input as a single raw string.  \n  * Input: Raw text from `stdin` (may contain new-lines; treat everything as one continuous string).  \n  * Output: One string `memory`.  \n  * Details: `memory = sys.stdin.read()` strips nothing; keep all characters so regex sees them.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Compile Regular Expression**\n  * Objective: Build a pattern that only matches valid instructions per rules.  \n  * Input: N/A (hard-coded pattern).  \n  * Output: `pattern` – compiled regex object.  \n  * Techniques:  \n    * Regex literal: `r"mul\\(([1-9]\\d{0,2}),([1-9]\\d{0,2})\\)"`  \n      * `mul\\(` – exact keyword with open paren.  \n      * `([1-9]\\d{0,2})` – captures 1–3 digit number, disallowing a leading zero and restricting to 1-999.  \n      * `,` – literal comma.  \n      * same capture for Y.  \n      * `\\)` – closing paren.  \n  * Constraints/Rules: No whitespace allowed anywhere inside; the pattern enforces this. Numbers larger than 999 or 0 are rejected.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Find All Valid Instructions**\n  * Description: Iterate through the string, extracting every non-overlapping regex match.  \n  * Input: `memory`, `pattern`.  \n  * Output: Iterator (or implicit loop) yielding each match object.  \n  * Techniques: `for m in pattern.finditer(memory): …`  \n  * Constraints/Rules: Standard `finditer` already ensures matches do not overlap. Overlaps cannot represent two valid `mul` patterns simultaneously due to the required literal text, so this is fine.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Compute Products and Accumulate**\n  * Description: For each match, parse captured groups to integers, multiply, add to accumulator.  \n  * Input: Match object (`m`), running `total`.  \n  * Output: Updated `total`.  \n  * Techniques:  \n    * `x = int(m.group(1))`  \n    * `y = int(m.group(2))`  \n    * `total += x * y`  \n  * Constraints/Rules: No overflow concern in Python; numbers ≤ 999, count may be large but sum well within Python int range.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print the final sum.  \n  * Input: `total` (integer).  \n  * Output: Single line containing the integer result.  \n  * Details: `print(total)` ensures a trailing newline per usual AoC expectations.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Regular Expression pattern matching (`re` module) – O(N) scan of the input string.\n* Basic integer arithmetic for multiplication and summation.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Numbers must be 1–999; the regex enforces this. Values like `000`, `1000`, or `0` are ignored.\n* No whitespace allowed inside the instruction – `"mul(2, 3)"` or `"mul (2,3)"` must be ignored.\n* Extraneous characters before/after valid patterns are harmless.\n* Adjacent instructions like `"mul(11,8)mul(8,5)"` are separately detected.\n* Input could be empty; output should be `0`.\n* Very large memory string: solution is O(length) and uses constant extra memory – safe.\n\n## 6.

Overall Approach\nModel the input as a 2-D character grid and perform a systematic search for the word “XMAS”.  \nFor every cell that contains the letter ‘X’ treat it as a potential starting point and attempt to match the remaining letters (“M”, “A”, “S”) in each of the eight compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).  \nIncrease a running counter whenever all four letters match without stepping outside the grid.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `grid : List[List[str]]` – 2-D list where `grid[r][c]` is the uppercase letter at row `r`, column `c`. Enables O(1) indexed access.\n* `directions : List[Tuple[int,int]]` – eight `(dr, dc)` pairs  \n  `[(−1, 0), (−1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, −1), (0, −1), (−1, −1)]`\n* `n : int` – side length of the square grid (len(grid)).\n* `count : int` – accumulator for the number of occurrences found.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Read all lines, strip trailing new-lines, ignore empty lines, and convert to a 2-D list of characters.\n  * Input: Raw multiline string from stdin or file.\n  * Output: `grid` (List[List[str]]) and `n` (int).\n  * Details:\n    * `lines = [line.rstrip(\'\\n\') for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]`\n    * Assert all lines have equal length; store `n = len(lines)`.\n    * `grid = [list(line) for line in lines]`\n\n* **Step 3.2: Prepare Constants**\n  * Description: Define the search word and direction vectors.\n  * Input: None (hard coded).\n  * Output: `word = "XMAS"`, `L = 4`, and `directions`.\n  * Details: Directions listed in Section 2.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Traverse Grid**\n  * Objective: Visit every potential starting cell.\n  * Input: `grid`, `n`.\n  * Output: Incremental updates to `count`.\n  * Techniques: Nested `for r in range(n): for c in range(n):`.\n  * Constraints/Rules:\n    * Skip cells whose character isn’t ‘X’ – they can’t start the word.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Directional Matching**\n  * Description: For each starting position `(r, c)` with ‘X’, test all eight directions.\n  * Input: `grid[r][c]`, `directions`, `word`.\n  * Output: For every successful match, increment `count`.\n  * Details:\n    1. For each `(dr, dc)` in `directions`:\n       * Quickly discard directions whose end-point would be outside the grid:\n         `end_r = r + dr*(L-1)`  \n         `end_c = c + dc*(L-1)`  \n         If `end_r` or `end_c` is `<0` or `>= n`, `continue`.\n       * Otherwise loop `k = 1 … L-1`:\n         * `nr = r + dr*k`, `nc = c + dc*k`.\n         * If `grid[nr][nc] != word[k]` → break (mismatch).\n       * If all characters matched, `count += 1`.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print the final count.\n  * Input: `count`.\n  * Output: A single integer to stdout.\n  * Details: `print(count)` – no extra formatting or whitespace.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Brute-force grid traversal (O(N² · L · 8)) – trivial for typical Advent-of-Code grid sizes.\n* Constant-time boundary check using pre-computed end-point.\n* No additional libraries required; pure Python 3.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Grid size smaller than 4 ⇒ result is guaranteed 0; code naturally handles this.\n* Overlapping words are allowed – counting logic does not prevent overlaps.\n* Backwards words and diagonals handled via full eight-direction search.\n* All letters are uppercase; no need for case conversion.\n* Input is guaranteed square, but include an assertion for safety.\n* Performance: even for 2000×2000 grid (4 million cells) runtime is acceptable (<1 s in CPython).\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer on its own line, e.g.  \n`18`\n\nImportant Reminders:\n* Count every occurrence; do not stop after finding the first.\n* Ensure boundary checks prevent index errors when scanning near edges.\n* Keep implementation modular (parsing, searching, output) for easy testing.'

Overall Approach\nParse the input into (1) a list of ordering rules “X|Y” and (2) a list of comma-separated page sequences.  \nFor every sequence, build a fast lookup table from page-number → position and test every applicable rule: if both pages of a rule are present in the sequence, the left page must appear earlier.  \nCollect the middle page of every sequence that passes all checks and output the sum of those middle pages.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `rules: list[tuple[int,int]]`  \n  Each tuple `(x, y)` represents the constraint *x must come before y*.\n* `sequences: list[list[int]]`  \n  Each inner list contains the page numbers of one update in the order they will be printed.\n* During validation of one sequence  \n  `pos: dict[int, int]` – maps page number to its index within the current sequence (enables O(1) look-ups).\n\nThese simple structures are adequate; a full graph is unnecessary because only membership and index comparison are required.\n\n## 3.

Strip trailing whitespace.\n    2. Split on the first blank line (`\\n\\n`) into `rule_block`, `seq_block`.\n    3. For every non-empty line in `rule_block`, split on `'|'`, convert parts to `int`, append `(x,y)` to `rules`.\n    4. For every non-empty line in `seq_block`, split on `','`, convert to `int`, append list to `sequences`.\n    5. Handle potential extra blank lines gracefully (ignore them).\n\n* **Step 3.2: Sequence Validation Loop**\n  * Description: Iterate through each sequence and decide if it respects all applicable rules.\n  * Input: `rules`, `sequences`.\n  * Output: `valid_middles: list[int]` containing the middle page of every valid sequence.\n  * Details:\n    1. Initialize empty list `valid_middles`.\n    2. For each `seq` in `sequences`:\n       a. Build `pos = {page: idx for idx, page in enumerate(seq)}`.  \n          – If duplicates could exist, keep the *earliest* index (first occurrence).\n       b. For every `(x, y)` in `rules`:\n          • If both `x` and `y` in `pos` **and** `pos[x] ≥ pos[y]`, the sequence is invalid – `break`.\n       c. If the loop completes without violation, compute the middle page:\n          • `mid_idx = len(seq)//2`  (integer division; for odd lengths this is the unique middle. For even, use the lower index as default.)\n          • Append `seq[mid_idx]` to `valid_middles`.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Sum Valid Middles**\n  * Description: Produce the final answer.\n  * Input: `valid_middles`.\n  * Output: Single integer `total`.\n  * Details: `total = sum(valid_middles)`.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print result exactly as expected by AoC.\n  * Input: `total`.\n  * Output: A single line containing `total` with newline.\n  * Details: `print(total)` is sufficient.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Linear pass to build a hash-map (`dict`) for O(1) position look-ups.\n* Simple nested iteration: O(#rules + Σ(#rules checked per sequence)).  \n  Because each rule is tested at most once per sequence, overall complexity is `O(R + R*S)` where `R` = number of rules, `S` = number of sequences; acceptable for typical AoC input sizes.\n* Basic string parsing & conversion with `.split()`.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Ignore any rule if one or both pages are missing from the current sequence.\n* Sequences may omit many pages; ensure rule checking remains correct.\n* Duplicate page numbers (not expected) – use first occurrence; document assumption if duplicates are disallowed.\n* Very large rule/sequence counts – use O(1) look-ups (`dict`) to stay efficient.\n* Even-length sequences – decide policy (use lower middle) and comment; AoC likely supplies odd lengths only.\n* Blank lines or trailing spaces – strip during parsing to avoid `ValueError`.\n\n## 6.

Data Structures\n* `grid : list[str]` – raw map lines; constant-time indexing with `grid[r][c]`.\n* `n_rows, n_cols : int` – grid dimensions.\n* `dirs : list[(dr, dc)]` – ordered as `[UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT]` → `[(-1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1)]`.\n* `facing : int` – index into `dirs` (0..3).\n* `pos : (r, c)` – current row/column of the guard.\n* `visited : set[(r, c)]` – all distinct in-bounds cells the guard ever occupies.\n\nThese choices give O(1) look-ups and straightforward rotation (`facing = (facing+1) % 4`).\n\n## 3.

Strip trailing newlines; split on `\\n` to a list of strings.\n    2. Record `n_rows = len(grid)` and `n_cols = len(grid[0])` (assume rectangular).\n    3. Search every cell for one of `'^', '>', 'v', '<'`; that cell is `pos`.\n       • Map symbol to initial `facing` (`^:0, >:1, v:2, <:3`).\n    4. Replace that symbol with `'.'` in `grid` so it isn’t treated as an obstacle.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Initialization**\n  * Objective: Prepare tracking containers.\n  * Input: Items produced in 3.1.\n  * Output: Mutable `visited` set (initially containing `pos`).\n  * Techniques: Python `set` for uniqueness.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Main Simulation Loop**\n  * Description: Repeat patrol protocol until the guard would step outside.\n  * Input: `grid`, `dirs`, `pos`, `facing`, `visited`.\n  * Output: Updated `visited`; termination when exiting grid.\n  * Details:\n    1. `while True:`  \n       a.

Algorithms/Techniques\n* Straight-line **simulation** using direction vectors.\n* Constant-time **set membership** to count unique cells.\n* Modular decomposition: parsing, stepping, turning, moving.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Guard may start adjacent to boundary and leave on very first move.\n* Map guaranteed to contain exactly one guard symbol.\n* No other symbols beyond `.`, `#`, and guard marker.\n* Performance: grid sizes are modest (typical AoC); O(steps) where steps ≤ (#cells * 4) in worst case.\n* Ensure rotation logic is purely clockwise (UP→RIGHT→DOWN→LEFT→UP).\n* When a turn happens, guard *does not* advance that iteration.\n* Do **not** add out-of-bounds coordinates to `visited`.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer printed to stdout (or returned) representing  \n“the number of distinct map positions visited by the guard before leaving the mapped area.”"

Yield or append `(target, nums)`.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Single-Equation Solver**\n  * Description: Decide if a target is reachable given `nums` and only “+”/“\\*” operators evaluated left-to-right.\n  * Input: `target`, `nums` (length k ≥ 1).\n  * Output: Boolean `solvable`.\n  * Details:  \n    1.

Algorithms/Techniques\n* Incremental dynamic programming using a set of reachable cumulative values.\n* Early exit once the target appears to avoid unnecessary work.\n* Simple string parsing for input lines.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* A line may contain only one number after the colon (zero operator slots).  \n* All numbers are positive in examples; still handle zero gracefully (multiplying by 0).  \n* Very large targets or intermediate products – rely on Python’s big ints.  \n* Duplicate reachable values are automatically removed by the `set`.  \n* Performance: worst-case reachable set doubles each step (2^(k−1)), but k is typically ≤ 20 in AoC; deduplication plus early exit keeps computation fast.\n\n## 6.

Overall Approach\nParse the compact “disk-map” string into an explicit block array that contains either  \n• an integer (file-ID of the block) or  \n• the sentinel `\'.\'` for free space.  \n\nThen compact the disk by repeatedly moving the right-most file block to the left-most free block using a two-pointer sweep. This single linear pass produces the same final layout as the step-by-step simulation, but in **O(N)** time where *N* is the number of blocks.  \nFinally, compute the checksum by summing `index * file_id` for every occupied block.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n1. `List[Union[int,str]] blocks` – explicit per-block representation.  \n   • Holds small integers (file IDs) for files, `\'.\'` for free space.  \n   • Allows O(1) reads/writes needed by the two-pointer swap.\n2. Simple scalar variables:  \n   • `left`, `right` – indices of current left-most free space and right-most file block.  \n   • `checksum` – running total for the final calculation.\n\nThese structures keep the algorithm linear, cache-friendly, and easy to reason about.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n*Step numbers correspond to implementation modules/functions.*\n\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Convert the dense disk-map string into the `blocks` list.\n  * Input: Raw string (single line) such as `"2333133121414131402"`.\n  * Output: `blocks` list containing integers (file IDs) and `\'.\'`.\n  * Details:\n    1. Iterate through each character `c` in the input string, cast to `int` → `length`.\n    2. Maintain a boolean flag `is_file_segment`, starting `True`.\n    3. Maintain `next_file_id`, starting `0`.\n    4. If `is_file_segment` is `True`, append the current `file_id` to `blocks` exactly `length` times, then increment `next_file_id`.\n    5. If `is_file_segment` is `False`, append `\'.\'` exactly `length` times.\n    6. Flip `is_file_segment` each iteration.\n    7. Edge case: a `0` means “zero length”; simply append nothing for that segment.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Initialise Two Pointers**\n  * Description: Locate the first free space from the left and the first file block from the right.\n  * Input: `blocks`.\n  * Output: Integers `left`, `right`.\n  * Details:\n    * `left = index of first \'.\'` (scan from 0). If none found, array is already compact.\n    * `right = index of last non \'.\'` (scan from end). If none found, disk is empty.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Compact the Disk**\n  * Objective: Perform the repeated “move right-most file block to left-most free space” efficiently.\n  * Input: `blocks`, `left`, `right`.\n  * Output: `blocks` compacted in-place.\n  * Techniques:\n    1. While `left < right`:\n       a. Swap `blocks[left]` and `blocks[right]`  \n          (`blocks[left]` becomes a file block, `blocks[right]` becomes `\'.\'`).\n       b. Advance `left` to the next `\'.\'` (increment until `left >= len(blocks)` or `blocks[left] == \'.\'`).\n       c. Decrement `right` to the previous non-dot (decrement until `right < 0` or `blocks[right] != \'.\'`).\n    2. Loop ends when every free block is to the right of every file block (i.e., compacted).\n\n  * Constraints/Rules:\n    * Each block is touched at most once, giving O(N) time.\n    * Handles disks with no free space or all free space naturally.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Compute Checksum**\n  * Description: Sum `index * file_id` over all occupied blocks.\n  * Input: Final `blocks`.\n  * Output: Integer `checksum`.\n  * Details:\n    * Iterate `enumerate(blocks)`:\n      * If element is `\'.\'`: continue.\n      * Else it’s an int (`id`); accumulate `index * id`.\n    * Uses Python’s arbitrary-precision int; no overflow issues.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print / return checksum exactly as required.\n  * Input: `checksum` (integer).\n  * Output: Single line with the integer value.\n  * Details:\n    * Convert to `str` and write with trailing newline (typical AoC requirement).\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n• Two-pointer sweep (left-most gap, right-most file) – linear-time in-place compaction.  \n• Basic string → list expansion for parsing.  \nNo advanced algorithms are necessary; correctness relies on faithfully reproducing the specified move order.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n1. Disk already compact (no dots left of any file) → two-pointer loop never executes; checksum computed directly.  \n2. Disk entirely free (`blocks` only contains `\'.\'`) → checksum = 0.  \n3. Segment length `0` in input – simply skip adding blocks (still flip `is_file_segment`).  \n4. Very large inputs (millions of blocks) – algorithm is O(N) time, O(N) additional memory (the list itself), acceptable in Python when written efficiently.  \n5. Checksum can exceed 32-bit; Python int handles it automatically.\n\n## 6.

Overall Approach\nModel the map as a directed acyclic graph where an edge exists from any cell of height `h` to each orthogonally-adjacent cell of height `h+1`.  \nAssign an id to every `9`-height cell, then use **memoised depth-first search** (or recursive DP) to determine, for every cell, the set of `9` ids it can reach by strictly ascending one unit per step.  \nFinally, for every trail-head (height `0`) look up the pre-computed reachable-set size and add them together.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `grid: list[list[int]]` – numeric heights for fast arithmetic comparison.  \n* `nine_id: dict[(r,c)] -> int` – maps each height-9 position to a unique integer id.  \n* `cache: dict[(r,c)] -> set[int]]` – memoisation table holding the set of `9` ids reachable from a cell.  \n* Direction vector `DIRS = [(-1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1)]`.  \nThese structures keep the solution memory-light and make memoised union operations straightforward.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Read the puzzle input lines into a 2-D list of integers.\n  * Input: Raw multiline string (via `sys.stdin`).\n  * Output: `grid`, `rows`, `cols`.\n  * Details: Strip newline characters; every character is `0`-`9`. No impassable `.` appear in real input.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Locate Special Cells**\n  * Description: Identify all height `9` cells and all trail-heads (height `0`).\n  * Input: `grid`.\n  * Output:  \n    * `nine_id` mapping,  \n    * `trailheads: list[(r,c)]`.\n  * Details: Traverse grid once; increment an integer counter for each `9` found.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Memoised Reachability Function**\n  * Objective: Compute and cache the set of `9` ids reachable from any cell.\n  * Input: Cell coordinates `(r,c)`.\n  * Output: `set[int]` of reachable `9` ids.\n  * Techniques:\n    * Recursion + memoisation (`lru_cache` or explicit `cache` dict).\n    * For a height `9` cell: return `{nine_id[(r,c)]}`.\n    * For any other cell:\n      1. Initialise empty set `reachable`.\n      2. For each orthogonal neighbour `(nr,nc)`:\n         * If `grid[nr][nc] == grid[r][c] + 1`, union `reachable` with `dfs(nr,nc)`.\n      3. Store copy of `reachable` in `cache[(r,c)]` and return it.\n  * Constraints/Rules: Maximum recursion depth is ≤ 9, so Python recursion is safe.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Compute Trailhead Scores**\n  * Description: For each `(r,c)` in `trailheads`, call the reachability function once and record `score_i = len(reachable_set)`.\n  * Input: `trailheads`, `cache`.\n  * Output: `scores: list[int]`.\n  * Details: Because of memoisation, each inner cell’s reachable set is built only once even if many trailheads share paths.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Sum Scores**\n  * Description: Add all individual trailhead scores.\n  * Input: `scores`.\n  * Output: `total_score: int`.\n  * Details: Plain integer sum.\n\n* **Step 3.6: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print the final total as required by AoC (single line).\n  * Input: `total_score`.\n  * Output: `str(total_score)`.\n  * Details: Use `print(total_score)`; no extra spaces or text.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Directed graph modelling of strictly‐ascending steps.\n* Depth-first search with memoisation (top-down dynamic programming over a DAG).\n* Set union operations to gather distinct `9` ids.\n* Single traversal for input parsing; overall complexity  \n  *Time*: `O((R*C) * deg)` where `deg=4` (each cell processed once, each edge examined once).  \n  *Memory*: `O(R*C + #9)` – dominated by the memoisation table and id mapping.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* No trailheads → output `0`.\n* Multiple paths to the same `9` are counted once per trailhead (set deduplication).\n* Large numbers of `9` cells: sets may be large, but with ≤ 10 000 cells overall the worst-case memory is still modest.\n* Input may be a single row/column; neighbour checks must stay in-bounds.\n* No recursion depth issue (max depth = 9).\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer on its own line representing  \n“the sum of the scores of all trailheads”.'

Overall Approach\nModel the map as a directed acyclic graph where an edge exists from any cell of height h to each orthogonally-adjacent cell of height h + 1.  \nBecause heights strictly increase along valid trails, information can be propagated **downhill** (from 9→8→…→0) with one dynamic-programming pass:  \n• give every height-9 cell a unique ID,  \n• store for every cell a bit-set of the 9-IDs it can reach,  \n• for h = 8 down to 0, set each cell’s bit-set to the OR of the bit-sets of its h + 1 neighbours.  \nFinally, for every height-0 “trailhead”, pop-count its bit-set and add to the running total.\n\nThis processes every map edge once, is linear in map size, and avoids repeated BFS work.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `grid: List[List[int]]` – numeric height of each position.  \n* `bitmask: List[List[int]]` – same shape as `grid`; Python `int` used as an arbitrary-length bit-set where bit *i* signals that height-9 cell *i* is reachable.  \n* `nine_id: Dict[Tuple[int,int], int]` – coordinate → unique 0-based index for each 9-cell.  \n* Constants `DIRS = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]` for orthogonal moves.\n\n## 3.

Algorithms/Techniques\n* Topological / dynamic propagation on a DAG (heights strictly increasing).\n* Bit-set representation using Python’s arbitrary-precision integers for efficient OR & popcount.\n* Single linear pass per height level, giving O(R × C) time and memory.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* No 9s: every bitmask stays 0, final answer 0.\n* No 0s: loop in Step 3.5 finds none – answer 0.\n* Multiple 0s sharing reachable 9(s) – counted independently per trailhead as required.\n* Large grids (e.g., 300 × 300): algorithm remains linear; memory ≈ N × (bitset size).

Overall Approach\nModel the height map as a directed acyclic graph whose edges go from height h to the four orthogonally-adjacent cells of height h + 1.  \nBecause every valid hiking trail must rise by exactly 1 each step and ultimately stop on a height 9 cell, we can solve the problem with a single dynamic pass:\n\n• Give every height-9 position a unique index.  \n• Traverse the grid in strictly descending height order (9→0).  \n  – For every cell, build a bitmask (or set) containing **all** height-9 indices reachable by an increasing path that starts at that cell.  \n  – For height 9 cells the mask is just their own index; for any other height the mask is the bit-OR of the masks of its h + 1 neighbours.  \n\nThe score of a trailhead (height 0 cell) is the popcount (number of set bits) of its mask.  \nSum these scores to obtain the final answer.\n\nThis walks each cell once, touches at most four neighbours, and manipulates immutable Python `int` bitmasks, yielding O(#cells) time and memory that scales with (#cells + #height-9 bits).\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `grid : List[List[int]]` – numeric heights 0-9.\n* `height_buckets : List[List[Tuple[int,int]]]` – nine lists; `height_buckets[h]` stores coordinates of every cell of height h.\n* `nine_id : Dict[Tuple[int,int], int]` – maps each (row,col) whose height is 9 to a unique small integer 0‥k-1.\n* `masks : List[List[int]]` – parallel to `grid`; `masks[r][c]` is an `int` bitmask of reachable 9-indices.\n* Auxiliary constants: `DIRS = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]`.\n\nThese structures allow O(1) access to heights, neighbours and computed reachability masks.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Read the entire puzzle input into a 2-D grid of integers.\n  * Input: Raw multi-line string.\n  * Output: `grid`, `n_rows`, `n_cols`.\n  * Details:\n    • Strip trailing newlines, split into lines, convert each character `'0'..'9'` to `int`.  \n    • No impassable `.` characters appear in real input – the examples with `.` are explanatory only.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Bucket Cells by Height & Index Height-9 Cells**\n  * Objective: Prepare for height-descending processing.\n  * Input: `grid`.\n  * Output: `height_buckets`, `nine_id`, `nine_count`.\n  * Techniques:\n    • One linear scan; append coords to `height_buckets[h]`.  \n    • When `h == 9`, assign `nine_id[(r,c)] = current_index` and increment `current_index`.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Initialise Mask Matrix**\n  * Objective: Allocate result holder.\n  * Input: grid dimensions.\n  * Output: `masks` 2-D list filled with 0.\n  * Details: `masks[r][c] = 0` initially.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Propagate Reachability Masks (descending pass)**\n  * Description: Fill `masks` so each cell knows which 9’s it can reach.\n  * Input: `height_buckets`, `grid`, `DIRS`, `nine_id`.\n  * Output: Updated `masks`.\n  * Process (do once for each `h` from 9 down to 0):\n    1.

Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Trailhead with no adjacent height 1 will have mask = 0 → score 0.\n* Multiple distinct paths to the same 9 are irrelevant – union eliminates duplicates.\n* Large numbers of height-9 cells: Python `int` handles arbitrarily many bits; ensure bit shift uses `<<`.\n* Large grids: memory is O(N_cells); each mask is an `int` object (can be reused if equal across cells but that optimisation is optional).\n* Ensure boundary checks when inspecting neighbours.\n* Input might be a single line or rectangular grid – rely on line lengths for `n_cols`.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer followed by a newline, representing the sum of all trailhead scores.\n\nImportant Reminders:\n– Process heights in strict descending order to guarantee dependency resolution.  \n– Use bitwise OR to merge reachability information efficiently.  \n– Popcount each height-0 mask once; avoid recounting 9’s multiple times for the same trailhead."

Data Structures\n* `List[int] current` – the active sequence of stones for the current iteration. A Python `int` safely stores arbitrarily large values, so no special big-integer handling is needed.  \n* `List[int] next_` – the new sequence produced during an iteration. Re-create it every blink to keep the logic simple and to avoid in-place complications.  \n* Optional: constants `MULT = 2024` and `ITERATIONS = 25` for clarity.\n\n## 3.

Algorithms/Techniques\n* String manipulation for digit counting and splitting (`str()`, slicing).\n* Basic list construction and iteration.\n* Integer arithmetic (bigints supported by Python natively).\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* The rules are evaluated **in order**; once one matches, later rules are ignored.\n* `0` always triggers Rule #1, never Rule #2 (even digit count) or Rule #3.\n* When splitting, halves can evaluate to `0` (e.g., “1000” → “10” and “0”); keep them as integer 0 without leading zeros.\n* An empty half cannot occur because the digit count is even and we always split in the middle.\n* Input may span multiple lines or a single line; blank lines are not expected but the `split()` strategy tolerates any whitespace.\n* Performance:  \n  - 25 iterations, each touching every stone once ⇒ O(total_stones_after_25).  \n  - For typical AoC inputs this remains easily under time/memory limits (tens of thousands to a few hundred thousand integers).  \n  - If the data set turns out far larger, Python lists and ints still handle several million elements within AoC constraints.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer (the number of stones after 25 blinks) written to `stdout` with a trailing newline typical of `print()`.'

Data Structures\n* `List[str] stones` – ordered list containing the decimal representation (no leading zeroes, except the single character `"0"`) of every stone currently on the line.  \n  • Chosen because strings make it trivial to count digits (`len()`), split a number in half (`s[:k] / s[k:]`), and strip leading zeroes (`lstrip(\'0\')`).\n* (Transient) `List[str] next_stones` – collects the stones produced in the current iteration before replacing `stones`.\n\nNo additional complex structures are required; a simple list rebuild each iteration is sufficient for up to tens of thousands of stones.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Read the initial arrangement and convert every integer found into a clean string representation.\n  * Input: Raw puzzle input (arbitrary whitespace separated integers, possibly across multiple lines).\n  * Output: `stones` – list of strings, each representing one stone’s number without leading zeroes (except `"0"` itself).\n  * Details:\n    1. Read entire stdin (or file) as a single string.\n    2. Use `re.findall(r\'-?\\d+\', text)` or split on whitespace to extract all integer tokens.\n    3. For each token remove superfluous leading zeros via `lstrip(\'0\')`; if that leaves an empty string, replace with `"0"`.\n    4. Preserve order in the resulting list.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Pre-define Helper Functions**\n  * Description: Encapsulate recurring subtasks.\n  * Input / Output / Details:\n    * `strip_leading_zeros(s: str) -> str`: return `s.lstrip(\'0\')` or `"0"` if the result is empty.\n    * `split_even_digits(s: str) -> tuple[str, str]`: given an even-length string, return the two halves with leading zeros stripped via the helper above.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Iterate 25 Times**\n  * Description: Perform the simultaneous transformation exactly 25 times.\n  * Input: `stones` list from previous step.\n  * Output: Updated `stones` list after each iteration.\n  * Details:\n    ```\n    REPEAT 25 times:\n        next_stones = []\n        FOR each stone_str in stones:\n            IF stone_str == "0":\n                next_stones.append("1")\n            ELIF len(stone_str) % 2 == 0:        # even digit count\n                half = len(stone_str) // 2\n                left  = strip_leading_zeros(stone_str[:half])\n                right = strip_leading_zeros(stone_str[half:])\n                next_stones.extend([left, right])\n            ELSE:                                 # odd digit count and not zero\n                product = int(stone_str) * 2024\n                next_stones.append(str(product))\n        stones = next_stones\n    ```\n    * Converting to `int` is only done for the multiplication rule; Python handles arbitrary size.\n    * All operations are O(total-digits) per iteration, which is easily fast enough (≈ 55 k stones * ≤100 digits ≈ a few MB of work).\n\n* **Step 3.4: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Produce the final answer.\n  * Input: `stones` after the 25th iteration.\n  * Output: A single integer – the count of stones.\n  * Details: `print(len(stones))`\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Sequential simulation / state expansion.\n* String manipulation: length measurement, slicing, stripping.\n* Big-integer multiplication (native Python `int` handles arbitrary precision).\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Leading zeros after splitting must be removed; if a half becomes empty (e.g., `"00"` → `""`) treat it as `"0"`.\n* A stone value may grow to 70+ digits; representing as `str` keeps memory usage modest.\n* Input may contain:\n  * Single line or multiple lines.\n  * Extra spaces or line breaks – parse by whitespace.\n  * The number `0` (handled explicitly).\n* Performance: 25 iterations, final stone count O(10⁵) is trivial for modern hardware; no special optimization required.\n* Negative numbers are not mentioned; if they appear, the parity rule still works (minus sign not a digit). Safest approach: assume only non-negative inputs per description.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer printed to standard output (no additional text or formatting), representing “how many stones you will have after blinking 25 times”.'

Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Convert the raw text into a list of `Machine` objects.\n  * Input: Multiline string; groups of three lines separated by one or more blank lines.  \n    ‑ “Button A: X±Δx, Y±Δy”  \n    ‑ “Button B: X±Δx, Y±Δy”  \n    ‑ “Prize: X=targetX, Y=targetY”\n  * Output: `machines: List[Machine]`\n  * Details:\n    1. Read all lines, strip the trailing newline.\n    2. Iterate, accumulating three non-blank lines into a block.\n    3. Use one regex per line, e.g. `r'[-+]?\\d+'`, to pull the signed integers in reading order.\n       • Line 1 → `dxA, dyA`  \n       • Line 2 → `dxB, dyB`  \n       • Line 3 → `tx,  ty`\n    4. Create a `Machine` from those six numbers and append to the list.\n    5. Be tolerant of extra whitespace or multiple blank lines between groups.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Enumerate Press Counts per Machine**\n  * Description: Determine feasibility and minimum token cost.\n  * Input: Single `Machine` plus global constant `MAX_PRESSES = 100`.\n  * Output: `best_cost` (int) or `None` if unsolvable.\n  * Details:\n    1. Initialise `best_cost = ∞`.\n    2. Double loop:  \n       `for a in range(0, MAX_PRESSES+1):`  \n       &nbsp;&nbsp;`for b in range(0, MAX_PRESSES+1):`\n    3. Compute cumulative move:  \n       `x = a*dxA + b*dxB`, `y = a*dyA + b*dyB`.\n    4. If `(x == tx) and (y == ty)`, compute `cost = 3*a + b`; update `best_cost`.\n    5. After the loops, return `None` if `best_cost` is still ∞.\n\n  * Constraints/Rules:\n    * `a, b` must be non-negative integers within the 0–100 bound.\n    * Enumeration is 101×101 = 10 201 iterations per machine → easily <1 ms for hundreds of machines.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Aggregate Results**\n  * Description: Combine per-machine results into global optimum.\n  * Input: `machines: List[Machine]` and function from Step 3.2.\n  * Output:  \n    * `total_tokens` – integer, fewest tokens to win all winnable prizes.  \n    * (Optionally) `solvable_count` – how many prizes can be won.\n  * Details:\n    1. Set both totals to zero.\n    2. For each machine:  \n       `best = min_cost(machine)`  \n       If `best is not None`:  \n       &nbsp;&nbsp;`total_tokens += best`  \n       &nbsp;&nbsp;`solvable_count += 1`\n    3. No further optimisation needed: including every solvable machine always maximises prize count.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print final answer exactly as AoC expects.\n  * Input: `total_tokens` (and optionally `solvable_count` for intermediate logging).\n  * Output: A single integer on stdout (or whichever format the site requires).\n  * Details:\n    * Typical AoC answer format: just `print(total_tokens)`.\n    * If second part asks for the prize count as well, adjust accordingly, but keep token count primary.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Brute-force enumeration within a small bounded grid.\n* Regular expressions for robust integer extraction.\n* Simple minima comparison for cost optimisation.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Negative displacements (`X-17`) must be parsed correctly.\n* Machines where one or both buttons give zero movement on an axis (handle division by zero issues by staying with enumeration).\n* Multiple valid `(a, b)` pairs – always choose minimal `3a + b`.\n* Completely unsolvable machines – ignore them for token total but still count towards “maximum prizes” logic.\n* Ensure `MAX_PRESSES` bound is applied; if the real puzzle removes that bound, replace enumeration with Extended-GCD based Diophantine solving.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single line containing one integer:\n```\n480\n```\n(the total tokens for the provided example; actual input will yield a different number).\n\nImportant Reminders:\n– keep loops inside the 0–100 range unless the puzzle input dictates otherwise;  \n– test with edge cases: exactly one solution, multiple solutions, no solution, negative moves, zero moves."

Edge Cases and Constraints\n• Robots can share tiles; duplicates simply increment the same quadrant counter.  \n• Velocities or positions may be negative or exceed grid size; modulus handles both.  \n• Robots that land exactly on `x = 50` or `y = 51` must be excluded.  \n• Empty lines should be ignored; strip and skip if the line is `''`.  \n• The product may be zero if any quadrant is empty; this is valid.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer printed to standard output (with optional trailing newline), representing the product of the four quadrant counts after 100 seconds."

Data Structures\n* `grid: List[List[str]]` – mutable 2-D array holding `'#'`, `'.'`, `'O'`, or `'@'`.\n* `robot_pos: Tuple[int, int]` – current `(row, col)` of `'@'`.\n* `moves: str` – newline-stripped string containing only `^v<>`.\n* `dir_map: Dict[str, Tuple[int,int]]` – maps a move character to `(dr, dc)`.\n\nThese structures are simple, give O(1) cell access, and allow in-place updates while simulating.\n\n## 3.

Read all lines into a list.\n        2. Map lines appear first; stop when you hit a completely blank line **or** the first line that contains only `^v<>` characters (safe because map lines always contain `#` and/or `.`/`O`/`@`).\n        3. Strip the final newline from each map line and convert to `list(char)`; append to `grid`.\n        4. While building `grid`, locate `'@'` and store its `(r,c)` in `robot_pos`.\n        5. Concatenate the remaining lines (after stripping whitespace) into a single string `moves`.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Direction Lookup**\n    * Description: Define constant direction vectors.\n    * Input: None (static).\n    * Output: `dir_map = {'^':(-1,0), 'v':(1,0), '<':(0,-1), '>':(0,1)}`.\n    * Details: No edge cases.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Simulate All Moves**\n    * Description: Process every character in `moves`, updating `grid` and `robot_pos`.\n    * Input: `grid`, `robot_pos`, `moves`, `dir_map`.\n    * Output: Mutated `grid`, final `robot_pos` (not needed later but kept for completeness).\n    * Details:\n        1.

If `grid[nr][nc] == 'O'` (box or chain of boxes):\n               1. Find contiguous chain:  \n                  ```\n                  chain = []\n                  cr, cc = nr, nc\n                  while grid[cr][cc] == 'O':\n                      chain.append((cr,cc))\n                      cr += dr; cc += dc\n                  ```\n               2.

Else (`'.'` open):\n                  * Shift boxes **in reverse order** so each moves one step:  \n                    ```\n                    for br,bc in reversed(chain):\n                        grid[br+dr][bc+dc] = 'O'\n                    ```\n                  * Set old chain head (`nr,nc`) to `'@'`.\n                  * Set original robot cell to `'.'`.\n                  * Update `robot_pos = (nr,nc)`.\n        2. Complexity: O(total moves × max chain length). With wall borders the chain length ≤ grid width.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Sum GPS Coordinates**\n    * Description: Convert each box position to GPS value and accumulate.\n    * Input: final `grid`.\n    * Output: `total_sum` (int).\n    * Details:\n        ```\n        total = 0\n        for row, line in enumerate(grid):\n            for col, ch in enumerate(line):\n                if ch == 'O':\n                    total += 100*row + col\n        ```\n\n* **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\n    * Description: Print/return the final answer.\n    * Input: `total_sum`.\n    * Output: A single integer on stdout (or function return).\n    * Details: Ensure no extra spaces or lines unless AoC format requires a trailing newline (safe to end with newline in Python `print`).\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Grid simulation with in-place updates.\n* Reverse iteration to shift a chain without overwriting.\n* Simple string/array parsing; no advanced algorithms needed.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Move line(s) can be very long – read as string, avoid per-character concatenation in a loop.\n* Multiple consecutive boxes must be pushed as a whole; cancel if wall immediately follows the chain.\n* Robot never leaves grid because grid is surrounded by `#`.\n* Ensure coordinate calculation counts wall rows/columns (row 0/col 0 can be `#`).\n* Input may omit explicit blank separator; fall back on “first non-map line” heuristic.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nSingle line containing the sum of GPS coordinates, e.g.  \n```\n10092\n```\n\nImportant Reminders:\n* Keep the simulation general; grid size and move count are not fixed by the example.\n* Use 0-based indices when computing GPS (matches example: inner first row = distance 1).\n* Thoroughly test: pushing single box, pushing chain, cancelled push, open move, immediate wall."

Overall Approach\nModel each possible situation as a node `(row, col, dir)` in a weighted graph where  \n• an edge for “move forward one tile” has cost = 1, and  \n• an edge for “rotate 90° left or right” has cost = 1000.  \n\nRun Dijkstra’s algorithm from the start node “(S-row, S-col, EAST)” until any node whose position is `E` is dequeued; its accumulated cost is the minimum score.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `grid : list[str]` – original maze, one row per string.\n* `start : (int,int)` – coordinates of `S`; `end : (int,int)` – coordinates of `E`.\n* `DIRS : list[tuple[int,int]]` – index 0: EAST, 1: SOUTH, 2: WEST, 3: NORTH; each stores `(dr,dc)`.\n* `dist : dict[(int,int,int), int]` – best known score to each `(r,c,d)`.\n* `pq : heapq` – priority queue of `(score,r,c,d)` for Dijkstra.\n* Optionally `rows, cols : int` – grid dimensions; quick bounds check.\n* `WALL = '#'` constant for readability.\n\n## 3.

Algorithms/Techniques\n* Dijkstra’s algorithm on an implicit graph.\n* Priority queue (`heapq`) for efficient min extraction.\n* Constant-time neighbour generation leveraging orientation arithmetic.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Start and end can be adjacent; algorithm handles cost = 1 (plus rotations if needed).\n* Maze borders entirely walls – ensure bounds check prevents index error.\n* Multiple valid optimal paths; Dijkstra guarantees optimality regardless of tie.\n* Maze sizes may be large; avoid O(rows²) structures; only store visited states in dict.\n* Rotation-only path not allowed (cannot enter wall); forward move legality check crucial.\n* Orientation at `E` irrelevant; stop as soon as any orientation reaches `(end_r,end_c)`.\n\n## 6.

Overall Approach\nModel the problem as a weighted shortest-path search in a directed graph whose nodes are `(row, col, facing)` and whose edges correspond to the three legal actions:  \n• rotate left (+1000)  \n• rotate right (+1000)  \n• move one step forward (+1, allowed only if the cell ahead is not `#`).  \nRun Dijkstra’s algorithm starting from the single initial state “tile S, facing East”.  Stop when any state located on tile `E` is dequeued; its accumulated cost is the desired minimum score.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `grid : List[str]` – the raw maze, one string per row.  \n  Suitable because indexing is O(1) and walls (`#`) vs. open cells are needed constantly.\n* `start : (int, int)` – coordinates of `S`.  \n* `end   : (int, int)` – coordinates of `E`.\n* `DIRS : List[(dr, dc)]` – length-4 list mapping direction id → delta.  \n  Example ordering: `0=E, 1=S, 2=W, 3=N`.\n* `dist : dict[(r,c,d) → int]` – best-known score for each state, used for Dijkstra relaxation.\n* `pq : heapq` – priority queue of `(score, r, c, d)` implementing the Dijkstra frontier.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**  \n  * Description: Read entire stdin, strip trailing newlines, keep every line of the rectangular maze.  \n  * Input: Raw text from stdin/file.  \n  * Output: `grid` (list of lines), `rows`, `cols`, `start`, `end`.  \n  * Details:  \n    - Iterate over lines with `enumerate`; locate `'S'` and `'E'`.  \n    - Record their `(row, col)` coordinates.  \n    - Replace the `S` and `E` characters with `.` in the copied grid so they behave as normal open cells.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Initialisation**  \n  * Description: Set up direction constants and initial state.  \n  * Input: `grid`, `start`.  \n  * Output: `DIRS`, `initial_state`.  \n  * Details:  \n    - `DIRS = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]` for E, S, W, N.  \n    - `initial_state = (*start, 0)` because the reindeer starts facing East (id 0).\n\n* **Step 3.3: Dijkstra Search**  \n  * Description: Explore state space to find minimal score.  \n  * Input: `grid`, `start`, `end`, `DIRS`.  \n  * Output: `min_score` (int).  \n  * Techniques: Classic Dijkstra with a min-heap.  \n  * Details & Rules:  \n    1. Initialise `dist = {initial_state: 0}`; `pq = [(0, *initial_state)]`.  \n    2. While `pq` not empty:  \n       a. `score,r,c,d = heappop(pq)`; if `score` > `dist[(r,c,d)]` continue.  \n       b. If `(r,c) == end`, return `score` (first time we pop this location guarantees optimality).  \n       c. Generate neighbours:  \n          • Rotate left: `(r,c,(d+3)%4)` cost `score+1000`.  \n          • Rotate right: `(r,c,(d+1)%4)` cost `score+1000`.  \n          • Move forward: compute `nr = r+dr[d], nc = c+dc[d]`; if within bounds and `grid[nr][nc] != '#'`, neighbour `(nr,nc,d)` cost `score+1`.  \n       d. For each neighbour, if new_cost < `dist.get(neigh, INF)`, update and push into heap.\n  * Constraints:  \n    - All edge costs are positive so Dijkstra is valid.  \n    - Total states ≤ 4 * rows * cols; OK for typical AoC sizes.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Generate Output**  \n  * Description: Print the minimal score exactly as required.  \n  * Input: `min_score`.  \n  * Output: Single line/string containing the integer.  \n  * Details: Use `print(min_score)` with no extra formatting or text.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Dijkstra’s algorithm on an implicit directed graph.\n* Priority queue (`heapq`) for efficient O(E log V) traversal.\n* Constant-time neighbour generation via direction vectors.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Maze may have irregular border of `#`; ensure bounds check `0 ≤ r < rows`, `0 ≤ c < cols`.\n* Start tile may equal end tile (trivial maze) – algorithm handles by early goal test.\n* Large mazes: memory O(4*R*C) and time O( (4*R*C) log (4*R*C) ), acceptable for typical Advent of Code limits.\n* Paths with many turns: high rotation cost biases algorithm but doesn’t overflow 32-bit ints; still use Python `int`.\n* Guarantee movement only forward; no backward move is offered in neighbour generation.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer on stdout representing the lowest possible score, with no additional text or punctuation."

Overall Approach\nBuild a small virtual-machine simulator in Python.  \nParse the debugger dump (initial register values + comma-separated program).  \nRun the program step-by-step:  \n• fetch opcode (3-bit) and operand (next 3-bit number)  \n• execute according to the spec, mutating registers and/or the instruction pointer  \n• stop when the instruction pointer points beyond the last opcode  \nCollect every value produced by `out` and, after halting, join them with commas to produce the puzzle answer.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `regs : list[int]` – length 3, indices 0–2 represent registers A, B, C for O(1) access.  \n* `prog : list[int]` – each entry is a 3-bit integer (0-7); holds the entire program.  \n* `ip : int` – instruction pointer (index into `prog`).  \n* `out_buf : list[int]` – stores values output by `out` instructions, later joined into a single string.  \n* `OPINFO : dict[int, tuple]` – maps opcode → (`name`, `operand_kind`) where `operand_kind` ∈ {`"literal"`, `"combo"`, `"ignored"`}; keeps decoding logic centralized.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**  \n  * Description: Convert the textual debugger dump into register values and program array.  \n  * Input: Raw multiline string.  \n  * Output: `regs` initialised to `[A,B,C]`, `prog` as `list[int]`.  \n  * Details:  \n    1. Split input into lines, strip whitespace.  \n    2. For lines starting with “Register”, extract integer with `split(\':\')[1]`, map to index (A=0, B=1, C=2).  \n    3. Locate line beginning with “Program:”; everything after the colon is a comma-separated string of integers → map `int` → `prog`.  \n    4. Validate all program numbers are 0-7; raise error otherwise.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Helper – Evaluate Literal Operand**  \n  * Objective: Return the numeric value of an operand that is plain literal.  \n  * Input: `operand` (0–7).  \n  * Output: Same integer.  \n  * Techniques: direct return.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Helper – Evaluate Combo Operand**  \n  * Objective: Transform operand according to combo rules.  \n  * Input: `operand` (0–6) and current `regs`.  \n  * Output: Integer value.  \n  * Details:  \n    • 0–3 → same literal value  \n    • 4 → regs[A]  \n    • 5 → regs[B]  \n    • 6 → regs[C]  \n    • 7 must not occur; if encountered, raise `ValueError`.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Instruction Implementations**  \n  For each opcode, implement a Python function taking (`operand`, `regs`, `ip`) and returning new `ip`.  \n  * 0 – `adv`  \n    • Operand kind: combo (value `k`).  \n    • Compute `den = 2 ** k`; `regs[0] = int(regs[0] // den)` (floor toward 0 with `//`).  \n  * 1 – `bxl`  \n    • Operand kind: literal.  \n    • `regs[1] ^= operand`.  \n  * 2 – `bst`  \n    • Operand kind: combo.  \n    • `regs[1] = combo_val % 8`.  \n  * 3 – `jnz`  \n    • Operand kind: literal.  \n    • If `regs[0] != 0`, return `operand` as the new `ip` (no +2). Otherwise proceed normally.  \n  * 4 – `bxc`  \n    • Operand ignored.  \n    • `regs[1] ^= regs[2]`.  \n  * 5 – `out`  \n    • Operand kind: combo.  \n    • Append `combo_val % 8` to `out_buf`.  \n  * 6 – `bdv`  \n    • Same as `adv`, result stored in `regs[1]`.  \n  * 7 – `cdv`  \n    • Same as `adv`, result stored in `regs[2]`.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Main Execution Loop**  \n  * Input: `regs`, `prog`.  \n  * Output: populated `out_buf`.  \n  * Details:  \n    1. Initialise `ip = 0`.  \n    2. While `ip < len(prog)` (trying to fetch opcode inside program):  \n       a. `opcode = prog[ip]`  \n       b. If `ip+1 >= len(prog)`: halt (missing operand).  \n       c. `operand = prog[ip+1]`  \n       d. Use `OPINFO` to find operand kind; pre-compute `literal_val` or `combo_val` via helpers.  \n       e. Execute handler.  \n       f. If handler returned `None`, advance `ip += 2`; else set `ip` to returned value.  \n    3. Loop ends when `ip >= len(prog)` after fetch → halt.\n\n* **Step 3.6: Generate Output**  \n  * Description: Convert collected outputs into required answer.  \n  * Input: `out_buf` (list[int]).  \n  * Output: Single string – comma-separated integers (`",".join(map(str,out_buf))`).  \n  * Details: Ensure no trailing/leading spaces; print or return the string exactly.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Straightforward instruction decoding / finite-state simulation.  \n* Bitwise operations (`^`) and integer division (`//`).  \n* Helper dispatch table to keep opcode logic clean.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Operand value 7 in combo context must **never** occur—throw explicit error if it does.  \n* Division by 2**k where k is negative or very large: Python handles big ints; if negative, denominator is fractional – optionally guard against negative exponents (problem likely avoids).  \n* `jnz` jumps to any address; ensure jump target might equal `len(prog)` (legal – will halt on next fetch).  \n* Program might not emit any `out`; produce empty string.  \n* Ensure integer truncation mimics spec: use `//` (Python already floors toward −∞; to truncate toward 0 for negatives use `int(a / b)` if needed). The puzzle examples use non-negative A, so `//` is safe; add comment if signed input is possible.  \n* Performance: program length is small (3-bit numbers), a simple loop is fine.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single line containing the comma-separated sequence produced by all `out` instructions, e.g.  \n```\n4,6,3,5,6,3,5,2,1,0\n```\n\nImportant Reminders:\n• Keep code modular (parsing, helpers, instruction functions, main loop).  \n• Validate inputs; raise clear errors on malformed program.'

Overall Approach\nSimulate the custom 3-bit virtual machine exactly as specified:  \n• Parse initial register values (A, B, C) and the comma-separated program list.  \n• Maintain an instruction pointer `ip`, three unbounded integer registers, and an output buffer.  \n• Step through the program, decoding the opcode at `program[ip]`, applying the corresponding rule to the operand at `program[ip+1]`, updating machine state, and advancing or jumping the instruction pointer.  \n• Halt when `ip` is past the final program index, then join all numbers produced by `out` instructions with commas to form the answer string.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `program: list[int]` – flat list of 3-bit integers (0-7).  \n* `registers: dict[str,int]` – keys \'A\',\'B\',\'C\' mapping to current values.  \n* `ip: int` – current instruction pointer.  \n* `output: list[int]` – values emitted by `out` instructions, preserved order.  \n\nThese are sufficient for stateful, mutable simulation and straightforward to use in Python.\n\n## 3.

Algorithms/Techniques\n* Simple state-machine / interpreter loop.  \n* Bitwise XOR (`^`).  \n* Integer floor division (`//`).  \n* Power-of-two calculation via exponentiation (`2 ** n`).  \nNo complex algorithms are required; everything runs in O(#instructions).\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Program may output zero values – return empty string.  \n* Combo operand 7 must raise a clear error if encountered.  \n* Guard against reading an opcode without a following operand (malformed input).  \n* Registers can grow large; Python’s unbounded `int` suffices.  \n* Exponentiation with large positive exponent can create huge denominators; still valid but may be slow—assumed reasonable by puzzle.  \n* Ensure `jnz` does NOT auto-increment `ip` after a jump; it directly sets `ip`.  \n* No trailing comma or spaces in the final output string.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single line containing all numbers emitted by `out` instructions, joined by commas, with no surrounding whitespace. Example:  \n```\n4,6,3,5,6,3,5,2,1,0\n```'

Overall Approach\nBuild a straightforward interpreter for the 3-bit computer described.  \nThe interpreter\n\n1. parses the initial register values and the comma-separated program,\n2. executes the program by repeatedly reading an opcode and its operand,\n3. updates registers and the instruction pointer according to the rules,\n4. collects every value produced by the `out` instruction, and\n5. returns the outputs joined with commas.\n\nThe whole run is a direct simulation; complexity is linear in the number of executed instructions and easily fits within AoC limits.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `program : list[int]`  \n  Holds the 3-bit numbers (0-7) that form the code. A Python list allows O(1) random access for opcode/operand fetches.\n\n* `reg : list[int]` length 3  \n  `reg[0] = A`, `reg[1] = B`, `reg[2] = C`. A fixed-size list is simpler and faster than a dictionary.\n\n* `ip : int`  \n  Instruction pointer (index into `program`).\n\n* `output : list[int]`  \n  All values generated by `out`. Collected during execution and finally turned into the required comma-separated string.\n\n* (optional) constant dictionaries / helper functions  \n  Map opcodes to handler functions and translate “combo” operands into integer values.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Read the three register lines and the program line.\n  * Input: Raw multiline string.\n  * Output:  \n    • `reg = [A, B, C]` (ints)  \n    • `program` (list[int])\n  * Details:\n    1. Split input into lines and strip whitespace.\n    2. For lines that start with `"Register"`, split at `\':\'` and convert the trailing number to `int`. Store in the correct register slot.\n    3. Find the line starting with `"Program:"`; take the substring after the colon, split on commas, strip, `int()` each part.\n    4. Ignore blank lines or extra whitespace; raise a descriptive error only if any expected section is missing.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Helper – combo_value(operand)**\n  * Objective: Translate a combo operand (0-6) into its integer value.\n  * Input: `operand : int (0-6)`, `reg`.\n  * Output: Corresponding integer.\n  * Details:\n    ```\n    0-3  -> literal 0-3\n    4    -> reg[A]\n    5    -> reg[B]\n    6    -> reg[C]\n    7    -> invalid (spec says it will not appear; assert for debugging)\n    ```\n\n* **Step 3.3: Execution Loop**\n  * Description: Run until `ip >= len(program)`.\n  * Input: `program`, initial `reg`.\n  * Output: `output` list.\n  * Details:\n    ```\n    ip = 0\n    while ip < len(program):\n        opcode  = program[ip]\n        operand = program[ip+1]   # safe because ip < len ⇒ ip+1 < len for valid code\n        dispatch according to opcode\n    ```\n    After every non-jump instruction, increment `ip` by 2. For `jnz`, update `ip` as specified and DO NOT add 2 afterward.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Opcode Handlers**\n  * All arithmetic uses Python `int`, which is unbounded.\n  * For any handler that needs the combo operand, call `combo_value(operand)` first.\n\n  0. **adv (divide → A)**  \n     ```\n     exp   = combo_value(operand)\n     denom = 1 << exp            # identical to 2**exp for non-negative exp\n     reg[A] //= denom\n     ip += 2\n     ```\n\n  1. **bxl (B XOR literal)**\n     ```\n     reg[B] ^= operand           # operand is literal\n     ip += 2\n     ```\n\n  2. **bst (store combo % 8 in B)**\n     ```\n     reg[B] = combo_value(operand) & 7\n     ip += 2\n     ```\n\n  3. **jnz (jump-if-A-nonzero, literal target)**\n     ```\n     if reg[A] != 0:\n         ip = operand            # operand is literal absolute address\n     else:\n         ip += 2\n     ```\n\n  4. **bxc (B XOR C, operand ignored)**\n     ```\n     reg[B] ^= reg[C]\n     ip += 2\n     ```\n\n  5. **out (emit combo % 8)**\n     ```\n     output.append(combo_value(operand) & 7)\n     ip += 2\n     ```\n\n  6. **bdv (divide → B, like adv)**\n     ```\n     exp   = combo_value(operand)\n     denom = 1 << exp\n     reg[B] = reg[A] // denom\n     ip += 2\n     ```\n\n  7. **cdv (divide → C, like adv)**\n     ```\n     exp   = combo_value(operand)\n     denom = 1 << exp\n     reg[C] = reg[A] // denom\n     ip += 2\n     ```\n\n  *Constraints / edge rules:*  \n    • Exponent may be large; bit-shift handles it.  \n    • Exponent should be non-negative; if negative appears, either raise or fall back to `2**exp` (float) with a clear comment—problem statement implies this won’t happen.  \n    • Operand `7` must never reach `combo_value`; assert to help debugging.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Halt Condition**\n  * The loop naturally exits when `ip` points past the final element; no extra opcode 99 is needed.\n\n* **Step 3.6: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Convert captured `output` list to final answer.\n  * Input: `output` list of ints.\n  * Output: String such as `"4,6,3,5,6,3,5,2,1,0"`.\n  * Details: `",".join(map(str, output))`\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Straightforward interpreter / state machine.\n* Bit-shift (`1 << exp`) for fast power-of-two denominator.\n* Bitwise XOR (`^`) for `bxl`, `bxc`.\n* Modulo with bit-mask `& 7` for “mod 8”.\n* Defensive assertions for invalid operands or opcodes.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Instruction pointer can jump anywhere inside the program; verify `0 ≤ ip < len(program)` before each fetch.\n* Programs always have an even length (opcode+operand pairs); if `ip == len(program) - 1`, treat missing operand as invalid and halt gracefully.\n* Very large exponents: `1 << exp` may be huge; Python handles big ints but memory/time could explode. Problem guarantees reasonable size.\n* Operand `7` in combo context is invalid; assert or raise `ValueError`.\n* Registers are unbounded signed integers; no overflow concerns.\n* A register value of `0` affects `jnz` logic—test both zero and non-zero cases.\n* Ensure no trailing commas in final output (use `join`).\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single comma-separated string of the integers produced by every `out` instruction, exactly as:\n```\nv1,v2,v3,...\n```\n(no spaces, no trailing comma, newline optional depending on AoC submission requirements)\n\nImportant Reminders:\n• Keep the interpreter modular: parse, exec loop, opcode handlers, helpers.  \n• Unit-test `combo_value`, division opcodes, and `jnz` separately.  \n• Confirm that the provided example yields `4,6,3,5,6,3,5,2,1,0` before running on the real input.'

Overall Approach\nTreat the grid as a fixed 71 × 71 board (coordinates 0-70 inclusive).  \nAfter reading the first 1024 “falling byte” coordinates, mark those cells as corrupted (blocked).  \nRun an ordinary breadth-first search (BFS) from the start (0, 0) to the target (70, 70) restricted to the four cardinal moves and avoiding blocked cells.  \nReturn the length of the shortest path; if none exists report that fact according to puzzle requirements.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `blocked: set[tuple[int,int]]` – constant-time membership test for corrupted cells.  \n* `deque` queue – BFS frontier.  \n* `visited: set[tuple[int,int]]` – cells already expanded; prevents re-visiting.  \n* Optional `directions: list[tuple[int,int]] = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]` – reuse for neighbor generation.\n\n## 3.

Overall Approach\nTreat each towel pattern as an indivisible “word”.  \nFor every requested design, decide if the design string can be segmented into a sequence of the available pattern strings (order‐sensitive, no reversals).  \nThis is the classic “word-break” problem and is solved efficiently with dynamic programming.  \nCount how many designs pass this test and output that number.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `patterns_by_len : dict[int, set[str]]`  \n  Maps each distinct pattern length to the set of patterns of that length.  \n  – Gives O(1) membership checks and limits comparisons to matching‐length slices.\n\n* `pattern_lens : list[int]`  \n  Sorted list of the distinct pattern lengths; lets the DP loop only over existing sizes.\n\n* `dp : list[bool]` (re-created per design)  \n  `dp[i]` is True if the prefix `design[:i]` can be matched by some sequence of towels.  \n  Size = `len(design)+1`.\n\n* (Optionally) `max_pat_len : int`  \n  Longest pattern length, to avoid slicing beyond string end.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**  \n  * Description: Read patterns and designs from stdin (or the given string).  \n  * Input: Raw multi-line string.  \n  * Output:  \n    * `pattern_list : list[str]` – individual patterns.  \n    * `designs      : list[str]` – one design string per line.  \n  * Details:  \n    * First non-blank line contains comma-separated patterns; strip whitespace around each piece.  \n    * A blank line separates patterns from designs; everything after that blank line is a design (skip empty trailing lines).  \n    * Remove duplicates while loading patterns.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Pre-process Patterns**  \n  * Objective: Build structures for O(1) look-ups during DP.  \n  * Input: `pattern_list`.  \n  * Output: `patterns_by_len`, `pattern_lens`, `max_pat_len`.  \n  * Techniques:  \n    * For every pattern `p` add it to `patterns_by_len[len(p)]`.  \n    * Compute `pattern_lens = sorted(patterns_by_len.keys())` and `max_pat_len = max(pattern_lens)`.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Evaluate One Design (Dynamic Programming)**  \n  * Objective: Decide if a single design string is constructible.  \n  * Input: `design : str`, `patterns_by_len`, `pattern_lens`, `max_pat_len`.  \n  * Output: Boolean feasible / not feasible.  \n  * Details / Algorithm:  \n    1. Let `n = len(design)`; create `dp = [False]*(n+1)` and set `dp[0] = True`.  \n    2. For `i` from `0` to `n-1`\u2003(if `dp[i]` is False, continue):  \n       * For every `L` in `pattern_lens`:  \n         * If `i+L > n`: break (lengths are sorted).  \n         * `substr = design[i:i+L]`.  \n         * If `substr` in `patterns_by_len[L]`: set `dp[i+L] = True`.  \n         * Optional early exit: if `dp[n]` becomes True, return immediately.  \n    3. Return `dp[n]`.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Count Feasible Designs**  \n  * Description: Loop through `designs`, apply Step 3.3, increment a counter for every True result.  \n  * Input: `designs`.  \n  * Output: Integer `possible_count`.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Generate Output**  \n  * Description: Print / return the final count exactly as required.  \n  * Input: `possible_count`.  \n  * Output: A single integer on its own line.  \n  * Details: Use plain `print(possible_count)` (no extra text).\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Dynamic Programming “word-break”: linear scan with look-ahead slices.\n* Hash-set membership for O(1) substring checks.\n* Pre-group patterns by length to minimise comparisons.\n* Optional micro-optimisations:  \n  – Track `max_pat_len` to bound slice length.  \n  – Early termination when `dp[n]` hits True.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Duplicate patterns – handled by using sets.  \n* Patterns longer than any design – harmless; DP never selects them.  \n* Very long designs – DP is O(N × #lengths); grouping by length and set look-ups keeps this performant.  \n* Empty design line – length 0; always possible (counts as 1) if allowed by problem spec; otherwise ignore if blank lines are input separators.  \n* Leading/trailing whitespace in input – strip while parsing.  \n* Only one pattern or only one design – still works.  \n* Characters limited to {w,u,b,r,g}; solution treats them as generic characters.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer representing the number of designs that can be created, followed by a newline. Example:\n\n```\n6\n```\n\n(No additional text or formatting.)'

Precompute the shortest distance from `S` to every track cell (`dist_start`) and from every track cell to `E` (`dist_end`).  \n3. Enumerate every possible cheat segment (start cell `A`, end cell `B`) that can be traversed in **exactly 1 or 2 moves** while ignoring walls.  \n   • For each `(A,B)` compute the best time with that cheat:  \n   `L_cheat = dist_start[A] + cheat_len + dist_end[B]`.  \n   • If `saving = L_normal - L_cheat ≥ 100`, count this cheat.  \n4. Output the total count of start/end pairs that meet the ≥100 ps saving requirement.\n\nBecause the cheat is uniquely identified only by its start and end positions, the intermediate cell(s) for a 2-step cheat are irrelevant once we know that at least one 2-move sequence exists inside the grid.\n\n## 2.

Overall Approach\nModel each keypad as a small grid-graph whose vertices are the printable buttons and whose edges connect orthogonally-adjacent buttons.  \n“Typing” a string on a keypad is a shortest-path problem in this graph: for every character we must (1) move the arm from its current vertex to the vertex labelled with that character, and (2) press `A` to emit the character.  \nFor the numeric door keypad we produce one lowest-cost sequence (`S₂`).  \nThe two robot directional keypads repeat the same “type a string” problem recursively:\n\nYou (D₀) → Robot #1 keypad (D₁) → Robot #2 keypad (D₂) → Numeric keypad (N).\n\nHence, for every door code `C` we:\n\n1. Build the shortest arrow/`A` sequence on N (`S₂`).\n2. Build the shortest sequence on D₂ that outputs `S₂` (`S₁`).\n3. Build the shortest sequence on D₁ that outputs `S₁` (`S₀`).  \n   The length of `S₀` is the number of physical button presses you must perform.\n4. Complexity for this code = `len(S₀)` × numeric value of `C` (digits only, leading zeros removed).\n\nSum the five complexities.\n\n## 2.

Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Read exactly five non-empty lines; each is a door code like `029A`.\n  * Input: Raw multiline input.\n  * Output: `codes` – list of five strings stripped of whitespace.\n  * Details: Validate that each line ends with `A` and contains only `0-9` and possibly the trailing `A`.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Build Keypad Graphs**\n  * Objective: Encode numeric keypad `N` and directional keypad `D` layouts.\n  * Input: none (hard-coded layouts).\n  * Output: `keypad_pos_N`, `keypad_pos_D` dictionaries and adjacency lists.\n  * Techniques: Manually fill coordinate tables, then for each button add edges to N/E/S/W neighbours whose coordinates also appear in the table.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Pre-compute Shortest Direction Strings**\n  * Objective: For every ordered pair of buttons (src,dst) on each keypad, store one shortest path as a string of `^v<>`.\n  * Input: Keypad graphs from 3.2.\n  * Output: `num_paths`, `dir_paths`.\n  * Techniques: BFS from each button; when we reach another button record both distance and the path of directions.  \n  * Constraints: Keypads are tiny (≤12 vertices) so pre-computation is trivial.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Helper `type_on_keypad(seq_to_emit, paths_table)`**\n  * Description: Given a target output string `T` and the path table for the current keypad, build the minimal sequence that makes the robot emit `T`.\n  * Input:  \n    * `T` – string to emit (characters are always one of `^v<>A`).  \n    * `paths_table` – either `dir_paths` (for D) or `num_paths` (for N).\n  * Output: `out_seq` – minimal button-press sequence as a string.\n  * Details:  \n    1. Initialise `cur = \'A\'`, `out_seq = []`.  \n    2. For each `char c` in `T`:  \n       a. Append `paths_table[(cur,c)]` to `out_seq`.  \n       b. Append `\'A\'` (the press).  \n       c. `cur = c`.  \n    3.

Algorithms/Techniques\n* Breadth-First Search on very small grids to obtain shortest paths.\n* Pre-computation / memoization of pair-wise paths to speed up sequence generation.\n* String building for nested sequence construction.\n* Basic parsing and integer conversion for leading-zero numeric parts.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Distances must avoid keypad gaps; BFS uses only valid neighbours.\n* Consecutive identical characters (`c == cur`) imply zero move cost; still append one `\'A\'`.\n* Codes may have leading zeros; always strip them with `int(...)` (empty string → 0).\n* All sequences must be shortest; BFS guarantees optimality, and each layer’s algorithm is optimal by construction.\n* Resulting sequences can be long (length grows roughly cubically with code length) but still negligible (< 10⁶) for typical AoC inputs.\n\n## 6.

Default input sizes for AoC are much smaller.\n* Ensure 2000 iterations exactly – do not off-by-one (initial secret is generation 0).\n* Use Python’s arbitrary-precision ints; no overflow issues.\n\n## 6.

Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Empty input → sum is 0 (handled naturally).\n* Negative initial secrets → use `% MOD` instead of `& MASK` inside `step` or add a sign-check.\n* Very large initial secrets → safe; Python ints unbounded and we reduce modulo 2²⁴ every sub-step.\n* Performance: O(B · 2000) where B = number of buyers; with typical AoC input (<10 000) this runs instantly.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer printed to STDOUT: the sum of the 2000-th secret number produced by each buyer.'

Overall Approach\nModel the whole circuit as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are wires and whose edges point from input wires to the gate output wire.  \nParse the input into  \n• a set of wires with initial constant values (sources) and  \n• a dictionary describing every gate (target wire → operation, input-wire-1, input-wire-2).  \n\nImplement a memoised recursive evaluator `value(wire)` that  \n1. returns an already-known constant if available,  \n2. otherwise recursively evaluates the gate’s two input wires, applies the gate’s boolean operator (AND, OR, XOR) and caches the result (0/1).  \n\nFinally, collect every wire whose name starts with `z`, sort them by their numeric suffix so that `z00` is bit 0 (least-significant), convert that ordered bit list into an integer, and print the decimal value.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `const: dict[str,int]`  \n  Wire → 0/1 for every wire that starts with a value (`x00: 1` lines).  \n* `gates: dict[str, tuple[str,str,str]]`  \n  Key = output wire, value = `(op, in1, in2)` where `op ∈ {"AND","OR","XOR"}` and `in1`,`in2` are wire names.  \n* `cache: dict[str,int]`  \n  Memoisation table; once a wire’s value is computed store 0/1 here.  \n* `pattern` (compiled regex)  \n  Quickly extract wire prefix and numeric suffix for ordering of `z` wires.\n\nThese are all simple Python built-ins, making the solution fast and memory-light.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Split the raw input into the “initial values” section and the “gate definitions” section.\n  * Input: A list of text lines.\n  * Output: `const` and `gates` dictionaries populated.\n  * Details:\n    1. Read line-by-line until the first blank line ⇒ section 1.  \n       Format: `wire_name: value` where `value` is `0` or `1`.  \n       ‑ Validate the value is either 0 or 1; store in `const`.\n    2. Remaining non-empty lines ⇒ section 2.  \n       Format: `in1 OP in2 -> out`, `OP ∈ {AND, OR, XOR}`.  \n       ‑ Use `split()` to obtain tokens.  \n       ‑ Store `gates[out] = (OP, in1, in2)`.\n    3. Ignore / strip surrounding whitespace; be robust to multiple blank lines at ends.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Wire Evaluation Function**\n  * Objective: Compute and cache the boolean value flowing through any wire.\n  * Input: Wire name `w`.\n  * Output: Integer 0 or 1.\n  * Techniques: Recursion with memoisation (`cache` dict).\n  * Details:\n    1. If `w` in `cache` ⇒ return cached value.  \n    2. If `w` in `const` ⇒ `cache[w] = const[w]; return`.  \n    3. Otherwise fetch `op, a, b = gates[w]`.  \n       Evaluate `va = value(a)` and `vb = value(b)`.  \n       Compute:  \n       ‑ AND ⇒ `val = va & vb`  \n       ‑ OR  ⇒ `val = va | vb`  \n       ‑ XOR ⇒ `val = va ^ vb`  \n       Store `cache[w] = val` and return.\n    4. Because the graph is acyclic, recursion terminates; memoisation guarantees each wire only computed once (O(#wires)).\n\n* **Step 3.3: Collect z-Wires**\n  * Description: Identify every wire whose name starts with the literal `\'z\'`.\n  * Input: Union of keys from `const`, `gates` (complete wire set).\n  * Output: `z_bits: dict[int,int]` mapping numeric suffix → bit value.\n  * Details:\n    1. Regex `r"z(\\d+)$"` extracts the suffix digits.  \n    2. For every matching wire `w`:  \n       `idx = int(suffix)`  \n       `bit = value(w)`  \n       `z_bits[idx] = bit`\n    3. This allows for sparse indices; missing indices implicitly 0.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Combine Bits into Integer**\n  * Description: Convert the collected bits (little-endian) into one decimal number.\n  * Input: `z_bits` dict.\n  * Output: Single integer `result`.\n  * Details:\n    1. `max_idx = max(z_bits) if z_bits else -1`  \n    2. Initialise `result = 0`.  \n    3. For `i` from 0 to `max_idx`:  \n       `bit = z_bits.get(i, 0)`  \n       `result |= bit << i`\n    4. This preserves leading zeros and correctly positions each bit.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print or return the decimal number.\n  * Input: `result`.\n  * Output: A single line/string containing the decimal value.\n  * Details: Convert `result` to `str` and write exactly as required (no extra spaces).\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Regex parsing for wire names and numeric suffixes.\n* DAG evaluation via memoised recursion (depth-first traversal).\n* Bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`) to compute gate outputs and assemble the final integer.\n* Dictionary memoisation for O(1) wire look-ups after first computation.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* The circuit is guaranteed acyclic, but implement memoisation to prevent exponential re-computation.\n* Some wires (even `z` wires) might rely solely on constants; ensure both constants and computed values are handled identically.\n* There may be “gaps” in the `z` indices (`z00`, `z03`, no `z01/z02`). Treat missing bits as 0 when assembling the final number.\n* Input could contain extra blank lines or trailing spaces—strip / ignore safely.\n* Only `AND`, `OR`, `XOR` gates are present; if another token appears, raise a clear error message.\n* Values are strictly boolean (0/1) so no overflow concerns.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer printed to standard output (or returned by a function) representing the decimal value obtained from the combined `z` bits, with no additional text or formatting.'

Data Structures\n* `wire_value: dict[str, Optional[int]]`  \n  Maps each wire name to `None`, `0`, or `1`.\n* `waiting: dict[str, list[Gate]]`  \n  Maps a wire name to every gate that depends on that wire.\n* `Gate` (namedtuple / dataclass) with fields  \n  `in1: str`, `in2: str`, `op: str`, `out: str`, `missing: int`.\n* `ready_queue: collections.deque[str]`  \n  Wires whose value has just become known and must be propagated.\n* `z_bits: dict[int, int]`  \n  Maps bit index (e.g., 0 for `z00`) to 0/1 for final assembly.\n\nThese are simple, hash-based containers—ideal for fast O(1) look-ups, updates, and iterations.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n*Step 3.1: Input Parsing*  \n  • Objective: convert raw input into initial‐value lines and gate definitions.  \n  • Input: full multiline puzzle input string.  \n  • Output:  \n    – `initial_lines: list[tuple[str, int]]` – (wire, value) pairs.  \n    – `gate_lines: list[tuple[str, str, str, str]]` – (in1, op, in2, out).  \n  • Details:  \n    – Split into lines, ignore blank lines.  \n    – A line containing `:` (“x00: 1”) is an initial value: `wire = left.strip()`, `value = int(right)`.  \n    – Otherwise match pattern `A AND|OR|XOR B -> C` with regex or split: `in1 = parts[0]`, `op = parts[1]`, `in2 = parts[2]`, `out = parts[4]`.\n\n*Step 3.2: Initialise Circuit State*  \n  • Objective: build `wire_value`, `Gate` objects, and dependency lists.  \n  • Input: `initial_lines`, `gate_lines`.  \n  • Output: populated `wire_value`, `waiting`, list `gates`.  \n  • Techniques:  \n    – For every initial line: `wire_value[wire] = value`, push `wire` onto `ready_queue`.  \n    – For every gate line:  \n        • create `Gate(in1, in2, op, out, missing=2)`;  \n        • append to global `gates` list;  \n        • add gate to `waiting[in1]` and `waiting[in2]` lists;  \n        • ensure `wire_value.setdefault(any_wire, None)` for all wires.  \n  • Constraints: inputs may occasionally be literal “0”/“1”; treat them as pseudo-wires that start with that value.\n\n*Step 3.3: Propagate Known Values*  \n  • Objective: evaluate all gates once both inputs are known.  \n  • Input: `ready_queue` of wires whose value is now determined.  \n  • Output: updated `wire_value` with every resolvable wire set; queue emptied.  \n  • Algorithm:  \n    ```\n    while ready_queue:\n        w = ready_queue.popleft()\n        for gate in waiting.get(w, []):\n            gate.missing -= 1\n            if gate.missing == 0:\n                a = wire_value[gate.in1]\n                b = wire_value[gate.in2]\n                out_val = op_table[gate.op](a, b)\n                wire_value[gate.out] = out_val\n                ready_queue.append(gate.out)\n    ```  \n  • Techniques: constant-time boolean ops via dict:  \n    `op_table = {'AND': lambda a,b: a & b, 'OR': a|b, 'XOR': a^b}`.  \n  • Constraints: DAG guarantees termination; guard that both `a` and `b` are not None before evaluation.\n\n*Step 3.4: Collect z-Wire Bits*  \n  • Objective: extract final bit pattern.  \n  • Input: final `wire_value`.  \n  • Output: `z_bits` dict.  \n  • Details: iterate over `wire_value.items()`, for any wire starting with `'z'`:  \n    – `idx = int(wire[1:])` (handles leading zeros)  \n    – `z_bits[idx] = value` (value is 0 or 1).\n\n*Step 3.5: Convert Bits to Decimal*  \n  • Objective: build the integer represented by the z bits.  \n  • Input: `z_bits`.  \n  • Output: single integer `answer`.  \n  • Details:  \n    ```\n    max_bit = max(z_bits)          # highest index\n    answer = 0\n    for i in range(max_bit, -1, -1):\n        answer = (answer << 1) | z_bits.get(i, 0)\n    ```  \n    (equivalent to little-endian spec since `z00` is LSB).\n\n*Step 3.6: Generate Output*  \n  • Objective: print / return final decimal number.  \n  • Input: `answer`.  \n  • Output: single line/string containing the decimal value.  \n  • Details: strict formatting—just the integer plus a trailing newline if desired.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Queue-based topological evaluation (Kahn-style).  \n* Hash maps for constant-time wire look-ups.  \n* Bitwise boolean operations (`&`, `|`, `^`).  \n* Binary-to-decimal conversion by bit shifting.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* There are no cycles, but still guard against infinite loops by counting remaining gates.  \n* Input wires may have leading zeros (`z00`)—parse numeric suffix with `int()`, not slicing by fixed width.  \n* Some bit indices might be missing; treat absent wires as 0 when assembling the final number.  \n* Handle the rare case of literal `0`/`1` tokens as immediate known wires to avoid waiting indefinitely.  \n* Performance: a few thousand gates → O(N) with queue; easily within limits.  \n* Memory: dictionaries hold at most O(#wires + #gates) entries—trivial.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single decimal integer (no additional text). Example:  \n```\n2024\n```\n\nImportant Reminders:\n• Keep steps modular (parse → build → evaluate → assemble → output).  \n• Ensure every wire is inserted into `wire_value` with default `None` so look-ups never fail.  \n• Test on the provided small and large examples before submitting."

Overall Approach\nModel the circuit as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each wire is a node and each gate is a function that combines two input wires into one output wire.  \nParse the input to capture (a) initial constant‐valued wires and (b) gate definitions.  \nEvaluate any requested wire value with a recursive, memoised depth-first walk (topological evaluation on demand).  \nFinally, collect the values of every wire whose name starts with `z`, order them by the numeric suffix (`z00`, `z01`, …), treat them as bits of a little-endian binary number, and convert that binary number to its decimal representation.\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `wires: dict[str, Wire]`  \n  Maps every wire name to a `Wire` object containing either a constant or a gate description.\n\n* `Wire` (simple data-class / `namedtuple`)  \n  • `const: Optional[int]` – 0 or 1 (if provided in the first section)  \n  • `op: Optional[str]`   – `"AND" | "OR" | "XOR"` (None for constants)  \n  • `in1: Optional[str]`  – first input wire name (None for constants)  \n  • `in2: Optional[str]`  – second input wire name (None for constants)  \n  • `value_cache: Optional[int]` – memoised evaluated value\n\n* `bit_values: dict[int, int]`  \n  Maps bit index (0 for `z00`, 1 for `z01`, …) to the evaluated 0/1 value, used when translating to decimal.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Read the raw input, split it into the “initial values” section and the “gate list” section.\n  * Input: Complete input text (possibly via `sys.stdin` or a file).\n  * Output: Populated `wires` dictionary containing one `Wire` entry for every wire observed (either as an initial-value wire, a gate input, or a gate output).\n  * Details:\n    * Iterate line-by-line; strip whitespace; skip empty lines.\n    * If the line contains `:` treat it as an initial value: `"x00: 1"` ➜ wire `x00`, const `1`.\n    * Else the line matches `INPUT1 OP INPUT2 -> OUTPUT`:\n      * Extract `INPUT1`, `OP`, `INPUT2`, `OUTPUT`.\n      * Ensure a `Wire` entry exists for `OUTPUT`; store `op`, `in1`, `in2`.\n      * Also ensure placeholder entries exist for `INPUT1` and `INPUT2` (if they have not appeared yet) so they can be looked up later.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Wire-Value Evaluation (Memoised DFS)**\n  * Description: Provide a function `eval(wire_name) -> int` that returns the 0/1 value carried by the wire.\n  * Input: A wire name string.\n  * Output: Integer 0 or 1.\n  * Techniques:\n    * Check `wire.value_cache`; if already computed, return it.\n    * If `const` is not `None`, cache and return the constant.\n    * Otherwise:\n      * Recursively call `eval(wire.in1)` and `eval(wire.in2)`.\n      * Compute result according to `wire.op`:\n        * `"AND"` → `v1 & v2`\n        * `"OR"`  → `v1 | v2`\n        * `"XOR"` → `v1 ^ v2`\n      * Because inputs are guaranteed to be 0/1, the result is also 0/1; optionally mask with `& 1` for safety.\n      * Store in `value_cache`, return it.\n  * Constraints/Rules:\n    * Graph is acyclic, so recursion is safe.\n    * Memoisation ensures O(N) total evaluations.\n\n* **Step 3.3: Collect z-Wire Bits**\n  * Description: Identify every wire whose name starts with `z`, evaluate its value, and map it to the correct bit index.\n  * Input: `wires` dict, `eval` function.\n  * Output: `bit_values` dict.\n  * Details:\n    * For each `name` in `wires`:\n      * If `name.startswith(\'z\')`:\n        * Extract numeric suffix: `int(name[1:])` (treat missing digits as `0`).\n        * `bit_values[index] = eval(name)`\n    * Note: If some indices are missing in the sequence, they will simply be absent from the dict (interpreted as 0 later).\n\n* **Step 3.4: Binary → Decimal Conversion**\n  * Description: Combine all collected bits into a single integer, little-endian (least-significant bit is `z00`).\n  * Input: `bit_values` dict.\n  * Output: Single integer `result`.\n  * Details:\n    * `max_index = max(bit_values.keys(), default=-1)`\n    * Initialise `result = 0`.\n    * For `i` from `0` to `max_index`:\n      * `bit = bit_values.get(i, 0)`\n      * `result |= (bit << i)`\n    * Handles missing bits by treating them as 0.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Present the decimal number as required by the puzzle.\n  * Input: `result` from Step 3.4.\n  * Output: Printed (or returned) single decimal integer.\n  * Details: Ensure no extra formatting or spaces—just the integer followed by a newline.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Recursive memoised evaluation (depth-first search) for DAGs.\n* Bitwise boolean operations (`&`, `|`, `^`).\n* String parsing with `split` / regex for gate lines.\n* Binary-to-decimal accumulation via bit shifting.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Every gate waits for both inputs; our evaluation naturally enforces this since inputs are evaluated first.\n* Each wire is driven by at most one gate or constant, but may be used many times—memoisation prevents duplicate work.\n* No loops are present (guaranteed), but defensive code could detect recursion depth issues.\n* There may be gaps in the `z` numbering; treat missing wires as 0 bits.\n* Numeric suffix length is not fixed (`z0`, `z00`, `z123` are all valid); parse with `int(name[1:] or 0)`.\n* Constants section might define wires other than `x*`/`y*`; handle generically.\n* Input lines may contain extra spaces; strip / split robustly.\n* Ensure results are strictly 0/1; mask with `& 1` if using generic bitwise operators on larger ints.\n\n## 6.

Detailed Steps\n\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Split raw input into 7-line blocks separated by at least one blank line.\n  * Input: Raw multiline string (stdin or file).\n  * Output: `diagrams`, a list where each element is a list of exactly 7 strings.\n  * Details:\n    * Remove any trailing whitespace lines.\n    * Iterate through lines, accumulating seven non-blank lines per diagram.\n    * Raise an error if block sizes are not multiples of 7 (guards malformed input).\n\n* **Step 3.2: Classify Diagram Type**\n  * Description: Decide whether each 7-line block is a lock or a key.\n  * Input: One 7-line block.\n  * Output: `"lock"` or `"key"`.\n  * Details:\n    * Lock: first row is all `#`, last row all `.`.\n    * Key : first row all `.`, last row all `#`.\n    * Sanity-check these two conditions; if neither holds, treat as invalid (assert).\n\n* **Step 3.3: Convert Diagram to Height Profile**\n  * Description: Produce a 5-element tuple of integers.\n  * Input: Classified diagram block.\n  * Output: Height profile tuple (e.g. `(0,5,3,4,3)`).\n  * Techniques:\n    * Let `H = 7`, `W = len(row0)` (expected 5, but derive programmatically).\n    * For each column `c` in `0..W-1`:\n      * If diagram is a lock:\n        * `cnt = 0`\n        * Starting at row 0, while row r char == `#`, increment `cnt`.\n        * Height = `cnt - 1`  (subtract sentinel top row).\n      * If diagram is a key:\n        * `cnt = 0`\n        * Starting at row 6, while row r char == `#`, increment `cnt`.\n        * Height = `cnt - 1` (subtract sentinel bottom row).\n    * Store as `tuple[int]` so profiles are hashable/immutable.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Build Separate Lists**\n  * Description: Populate `locks` and `keys`.\n  * Input: Results from Steps 3.2–3.3.\n  * Output: Two lists of profiles.\n  * Details: Append each profile to the correct list maintaining original order (index identity matters).\n\n* **Step 3.5: Pairwise Compatibility Check**\n  * Description: Evaluate every lock with every key.\n  * Input: `locks`, `keys`.\n  * Output: `fit_count`.\n  * Techniques:\n    * Nested loops: for each lock profile `L` and key profile `K`:\n      * For each column index `i`:\n        * If `L[i] + K[i] > H - 2` (`5`), **reject** pair and break.\n      * If all columns pass, increment `fit_count`.\n  * Constraints/Rules:\n    * Complexity O(|locks| × |keys| × 5) — negligible.\n    * No early deduplication; every schematic instance counts individually.\n\n* **Step 3.6: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print the number of compatible pairs.\n  * Input: `fit_count`.\n  * Output: Single line/string with the integer result.\n  * Details: Use `print(fit_count)` to match AoC’s expected raw integer output.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Simple iterative scanning of character grids.\n* Constant-size per-column arithmetic comparison.\n* No advanced algorithms required; rely on Python built-ins and loops.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Input width should always be 5, but handle arbitrary consistent widths.\n* Multiple consecutive blank lines between diagrams – ignore extras.\n* All diagrams must be exactly 7 rows; assert otherwise.\n* Heights can be `0` (pin/ridge absent) through `5`; ensure subtraction logic works for `0`.\n* Large numbers of locks/keys: current O(n·m) approach is fine (n,m ≤ few thousand typical for AoC), but consider using integers for micro-optimisation if necessary.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer written to standard output with no additional text or whitespace.'

Overall Approach\nParse each 7-row schematic, classify it as a lock or a key, convert every column to a “height” integer, then brute-force every lock/key pair (only pairs with the same column count) and count those where, for every column, the combined heights do not exceed the available interior space (5 rows).\n\n## 2. Data Structures\n* `list[str] raw_lines` – all non-empty lines from the input file.\n* `list[list[int]] locks` – each lock represented as a list of per-column heights.\n* `list[list[int]] keys` – each key represented similarly.\n* `dict[int, list[list[int]]] locks_by_width` – map column-count → list of locks.\n* `dict[int, list[list[int]]] keys_by_width` – map column-count → list of keys.\n\nThese lightweight structures keep memory low and let us restrict comparisons to objects with identical widths.\n\n## 3. Detailed Steps\n* **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\n  * Description: Split the raw input into consecutive 7-line blocks (schematics), ignoring blank lines.\n  * Input: Raw multiline string.\n  * Output: `schematics`, a list where each element is a list of 7 equal-length strings.\n  * Details:\n    * Read all lines, strip end-of-line, discard blank ones.\n    * Iterate in chunks of 7; assert each chunk has identical line lengths (width).\n    * Edge case: final chunk must also contain exactly 7 lines.\n\n* **Step 3.2: Classify Each Schematic**\n  * Objective: Decide whether the block is a lock or a key.\n  * Input: One 7-line block.\n  * Output: Tuple `(kind, block)` where `kind` is `'lock'` or `'key'`.\n  * Techniques/Rules:\n    * Lock → first row is all ‘#’ and last row all ‘.’.\n    * Key  → first row is all ‘.’ and last row all ‘#’.\n    * If neither rule matches, raise an error (invalid input).\n\n* **Step 3.3: Convert Block to Height List**\n  * Objective: Produce per-column heights.\n  * Input: `(kind, block)` from previous step.\n  * Output: `heights: list[int]`.\n  * Details:\n    * Let `H = 7` (rows), `interior = 5` (rows 1–5).\n    * For each column index `c`:\n      * If `kind == 'lock'`\n        * Count consecutive `'#'` starting at row 0 downward until the first ‘.’.\n        * `height = count - 1`  (top row’s always `#`; subtract 1 so minimum lock height is 0).\n      * If `kind == 'key'`\n        * Count consecutive `'#'` starting at row 6 upward until first ‘.’.\n        * `height = count - 1`  (bottom row’s always `#`; subtract 1).\n    * Store in list in column order.\n\n* **Step 3.4: Build Lock/Key Collections**\n  * Description: Populate `locks_by_width` and `keys_by_width`.\n  * Input: Stream of `(kind, heights)`.\n  * Output: Two dictionaries keyed by width.\n  * Techniques: `defaultdict(list)`.\n\n* **Step 3.5: Pairwise Compatibility Check**\n  * Objective: For every lock/key pair with identical width, decide if they fit.\n  * Input: `locks_by_width`, `keys_by_width`.\n  * Output: Integer `fit_count`.\n  * Details:\n    * For each common `width`:\n      * Retrieve `L = locks_by_width[width]`, `K = keys_by_width[width]`.\n      * For each `lock` in `L`:\n        * For each `key` in `K`:\n          * For every column index `i`:\n            * If `lock[i] + key[i] > 5`, break (overlap).\n          * If all columns pass, increment `fit_count`.\n    * Complexity: O(#locks × #keys × width). With typical AoC sizes (hundreds or thousands), this is easily fast.\n\n* **Step 3.6: Generate Output**\n  * Description: Print the total number of fitting pairs.\n  * Input: `fit_count`.\n  * Output: A single line/string with the integer answer.\n  * Details: Exactly as required, no extra spaces or text.\n\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\n* Simple parsing and chunking of fixed-height ASCII diagrams.\n* Counting consecutive characters in a column.\n* Nested iteration for brute-force matching, optimized by grouping by column count.\n* Early exit in compatibility check to avoid unnecessary column tests.\n\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\n* Width may vary between schematics; never compare differing widths.\n* Confirm every block is exactly 7 lines and each line identical length.\n* Heights can legally be 0–5; still check sums against 5.\n* Large numbers of locks/keys: group-by-width keeps loops smaller.\n* No assumption that there is at least one lock or key of each width; handle missing keys/locks gracefully.\n* Strip trailing/leading blank lines in input.\n\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\nA single integer printed to stdout (or returned) representing the number of unique lock/key pairs that do not overlap in any column."
