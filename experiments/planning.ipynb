That\\'s what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can\\'t find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\\\\\v<\\\\\\\\l+>/` will match each \\\\u2018word\\\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\\\n\\\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\\\n\\\\n*Update:* Somehow I\\'ve made this work for part\\\\u00a02 as well \\\\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn\\'t make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2021 Citation needed.\"}, {\"solution_id\": \"solution-2\", \"code\": \"r\\\\u2190,p\\\\u2190\\\\u2191\\\\u2283\\\\u2395nget\\'03.txt\\'1\\\\n    m\\\\u2190(\\\\u2374p)\\\\u2374d\\\\u00d7+\\\\\\\\2</0,d\\\\u2190r\\\\u220a\\\\u2395D\\\\n    n\\\\u2190\\\\u234e\\\\u00a8d\\\\u2286r \\\\u22c4 g\\\\u2190,{\\\\u2282n[\\\\u222a0~\\\\u2368,\\\\u2375]}\\\\u233a3 3\\\\u22a2m\\\\n    +/\\\\u220ag/\\\\u2368~r\\\\u220a\\'.\\',\\\\u2395D \\\\u235d part 1\\\\n    +/\\\\u00d7/\\\\u00a8g/\\\\u2368(2=\\\\u2262\\\\u00a8g)\\\\u2227\\'*\\'=r \\\\u235d part 2\\\\n\\\\n[Video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77uUu4vcZ-8)\"}]}\\n'\u001b[0m\n",

Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\n\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_', solution={'solution_id': 'solution-0', 'code': \"p1 = sum(sum(p)  for p in parts.values()),\\n    p2 = sum(prod(p) for p in parts.values() if len(p)==2))\\n\\n*Edit:* Updated the code using /u/masklinn's clever insight.
