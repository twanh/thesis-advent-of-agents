Unfortunately\\u2021 digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\u2018digits\\u2019 upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist \\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each \\u2018word\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\u00a02 as well \\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n\\u2021 Citation needed.\"}, {\"solution_id\": \"solution-2\", \"code\": \"r\\u2190,p\\u2190\\u2191\\u2283\\u2395nget'03.txt'1\\n    m\\u2190(\\u2374p)\\u2374d\\u00d7+\\\\2</0,d\\u2190r\\u220a\\u2395D\\n    n\\u2190\\u234e\\u00a8d\\u2286r \\u22c4 g\\u2190,{\\u2282n[\\u222a0~\\u2368,\\u2375]}\\u233a3 3\\u22a2m\\n    +/\\u220ag/\\u2368~r\\u220a'.',\\u2395D \\u235d part 1\\n    +/\\u00d7/\\u00a8g/\\u2368(2=\\u2262\\u00a8g)\\u2227'*'=r \\u235d part 2\\n\\n[Video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77uUu4vcZ-8)\"}]}\n",

Unfortunately\\\\u2021 digits don\\'t have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\\\u2018digits\\\\u2019 upper-case.\\\\n\\\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\\\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn\\'t exist \\\\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That\\'s what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can\\'t find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\\\\\v<\\\\\\\\l+>/` will match each \\\\u2018word\\\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\\\n\\\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\\\n\\\\n*Update:* Somehow I\\'ve made this work for part\\\\u00a02 as well \\\\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn\\'t make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2021 Citation needed.\"}, {\"solution_id\": \"solution-2\", \"code\": \"r\\\\u2190,p\\\\u2190\\\\u2191\\\\u2283\\\\u2395nget\\'03.txt\\'1\\\\n    m\\\\u2190(\\\\u2374p)\\\\u2374d\\\\u00d7+\\\\\\\\2</0,d\\\\u2190r\\\\u220a\\\\u2395D\\\\n    n\\\\u2190\\\\u234e\\\\u00a8d\\\\u2286r \\\\u22c4 g\\\\u2190,{\\\\u2282n[\\\\u222a0~\\\\u2368,\\\\u2375]}\\\\u233a3 3\\\\u22a2m\\\\n    +/\\\\u220ag/\\\\u2368~r\\\\u220a\\'.\\',\\\\u2395D \\\\u235d part 1\\\\n    +/\\\\u00d7/\\\\u00a8g/\\\\u2368(2=\\\\u2262\\\\u00a8g)\\\\u2227\\'*\\'=r \\\\u235d part 2\\\\n\\\\n[Video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77uUu4vcZ-8)\"}]}\\n'\u001b[0m\n",

Unfortunately\\u2021 digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\u2018digits\\u2019 upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist \\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each \\u2018word\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer.

You go inside.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they\\'re not moving.\\n\\n\"Aaah!\"\\n\\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \"Sorry, I wasn\\'t expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn\\'t working right now; it\\'ll still be a while before I can fix it.\" You offer to help.\\n\\nThe engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can _add up all the part numbers_ in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\\n\\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don\\'t really understand, but apparently _any number adjacent to a symbol_ , even diagonally, is a \"part number\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.)\\n\\nHere is an example engine schematic:\\n    \\n    \\n    467..114..\\n    ...*......\\n    ..35..633.\\n    ......#...\\n    617*......\\n    .....+.58.\\n    ..592.....\\n    ......755.\\n    ...$.*....\\n    .664.598..\\n    \\n\\nIn this schematic, two numbers are _not_ part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: `114` (top right) and `58` (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\n\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_', solution={'solution_id': 'solution-1', 'code': \"⟨Ctrl+V⟩GI.⟨Esc⟩gvy$pYPVr.YGp\\n    :%s/\\\\d/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))+49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    qaqqa/[^.a-z]⟨Enter⟩r.kh⟨Ctrl+V⟩jjllU@aq@a\\n    :%s/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/./g⟨Enter⟩vipu\\n    :%s/\\\\l/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))-49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    :%s/\\\\v[.\\\\n]+/+/g⟨Enter⟩C⟨Ctrl+R⟩=⟨Ctrl+R⟩-0⟨Enter⟩⟨Esc⟩\\n\\nThe main `@a` loop† on line 3 finds every symbol, visually selects the 9 characters centred on it, and makes any digits in that block upper-case, to mark them as being adjacent to a symbol.\\n\\nWait ... upper-case digits?\\n\\nFlipping the case of a character is a handy way of marking it as having been ‘found’ while retaining its value. Unfortunately‡ digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the ‘digits’ upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges — which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist — first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each ‘word’ still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\xa02 as well — see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n† What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n‡ Citation needed.\"}, year=2023, day=3),\n",

You go inside.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they\\'re not moving.\\n\\n\"Aaah!\"\\n\\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \"Sorry, I wasn\\'t expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn\\'t working right now; it\\'ll still be a while before I can fix it.\" You offer to help.\\n\\nThe engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can _add up all the part numbers_ in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\\n\\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don\\'t really understand, but apparently _any number adjacent to a symbol_ , even diagonally, is a \"part number\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.)\\n\\nHere is an example engine schematic:\\n    \\n    \\n    467..114..\\n    ...*......\\n    ..35..633.\\n    ......#...\\n    617*......\\n    .....+.58.\\n    ..592.....\\n    ......755.\\n    ...$.*....\\n    .664.598..\\n    \\n\\nIn this schematic, two numbers are _not_ part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: `114` (top right) and `58` (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\n\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_', solution={'solution_id': 'solution-1', 'code': \"⟨Ctrl+V⟩GI.⟨Esc⟩gvy$pYPVr.YGp\\n    :%s/\\\\d/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))+49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    qaqqa/[^.a-z]⟨Enter⟩r.kh⟨Ctrl+V⟩jjllU@aq@a\\n    :%s/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/./g⟨Enter⟩vipu\\n    :%s/\\\\l/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))-49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    :%s/\\\\v[.\\\\n]+/+/g⟨Enter⟩C⟨Ctrl+R⟩=⟨Ctrl+R⟩-0⟨Enter⟩⟨Esc⟩\\n\\nThe main `@a` loop† on line 3 finds every symbol, visually selects the 9 characters centred on it, and makes any digits in that block upper-case, to mark them as being adjacent to a symbol.\\n\\nWait ... upper-case digits?\\n\\nFlipping the case of a character is a handy way of marking it as having been ‘found’ while retaining its value. Unfortunately‡ digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the ‘digits’ upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges — which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist — first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each ‘word’ still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\xa02 as well — see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n† What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n‡ Citation needed.\"}, year=2023, day=3),\n",
