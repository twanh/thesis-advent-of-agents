Unfortunately\\u2021 digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\u2018digits\\u2019 upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist \\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each \\u2018word\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\u00a02 as well \\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n\\u2021 Citation needed.\"}, {\"solution_id\": \"solution-2\", \"code\": \"r\\u2190,p\\u2190\\u2191\\u2283\\u2395nget'03.txt'1\\n    m\\u2190(\\u2374p)\\u2374d\\u00d7+\\\\2</0,d\\u2190r\\u220a\\u2395D\\n    n\\u2190\\u234e\\u00a8d\\u2286r \\u22c4 g\\u2190,{\\u2282n[\\u222a0~\\u2368,\\u2375]}\\u233a3 3\\u22a2m\\n    +/\\u220ag/\\u2368~r\\u220a'.',\\u2395D \\u235d part 1\\n    +/\\u00d7/\\u00a8g/\\u2368(2=\\u2262\\u00a8g)\\u2227'*'=r \\u235d part 2\\n\\n[Video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77uUu4vcZ-8)\"}]}\n",

Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_\", \"underlying_concepts\": \"{\\\\\"string manipulation\\\\\",\\\\\"2D array traversal\\\\\",\\\\\"conditional logic\\\\\"}\", \"keywords\": \"{\\\\\"grid processing\\\\\",\\\\\"number extraction\\\\\",\\\\\"symbol detection\\\\\",\\\\\"adjacency checking\\\\\"}\", \"solutions\": [{\"solution_id\": \"solution-0\", \"code\": \"p1 = sum(sum(p)  for p in parts.values()),\\\\n    p2 = sum(prod(p) for p in parts.values() if len(p)==2))\\\\n\\\\n*Edit:* Updated the code using /u/masklinn\\'s clever insight.

You go inside.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they\\'re not moving.\\n\\n\"Aaah!\"\\n\\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \"Sorry, I wasn\\'t expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn\\'t working right now; it\\'ll still be a while before I can fix it.\" You offer to help.\\n\\nThe engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can _add up all the part numbers_ in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\\n\\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don\\'t really understand, but apparently _any number adjacent to a symbol_ , even diagonally, is a \"part number\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.)\\n\\nHere is an example engine schematic:\\n    \\n    \\n    467..114..\\n    ...*......\\n    ..35..633.\\n    ......#...\\n    617*......\\n    .....+.58.\\n    ..592.....\\n    ......755.\\n    ...$.*....\\n    .664.598..\\n    \\n\\nIn this schematic, two numbers are _not_ part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: `114` (top right) and `58` (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\n\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_', solution={'solution_id': 'solution-1', 'code': \"⟨Ctrl+V⟩GI.⟨Esc⟩gvy$pYPVr.YGp\\n    :%s/\\\\d/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))+49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    qaqqa/[^.a-z]⟨Enter⟩r.kh⟨Ctrl+V⟩jjllU@aq@a\\n    :%s/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/./g⟨Enter⟩vipu\\n    :%s/\\\\l/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))-49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    :%s/\\\\v[.\\\\n]+/+/g⟨Enter⟩C⟨Ctrl+R⟩=⟨Ctrl+R⟩-0⟨Enter⟩⟨Esc⟩\\n\\nThe main `@a` loop† on line 3 finds every symbol, visually selects the 9 characters centred on it, and makes any digits in that block upper-case, to mark them as being adjacent to a symbol.\\n\\nWait ... upper-case digits?\\n\\nFlipping the case of a character is a handy way of marking it as having been ‘found’ while retaining its value. Unfortunately‡ digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the ‘digits’ upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges — which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist — first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each ‘word’ still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\xa02 as well — see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n† What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n‡ Citation needed.\"}, year=2023, day=3),\n",

You go inside.\\n\\nIt doesn't take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they're not moving.\\n\\n\\\"Aaah!\\\"\\n\\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \\\"Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone!

If you can _add up all the part numbers_ in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\\n\\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently _any number adjacent to a symbol_ , even diagonally, is a \\\"part number\\\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.)\\n\\nHere is an example engine schematic:\\n    \\n    \\n    467..114..\\n    ...*......\\n    ..35..633.\\n    ......#...\\n    617*......\\n    .....+.58.\\n    ..592.....\\n    ......755.\\n    ...$.*....\\n    .664.598..\\n    \\n\\nIn this schematic, two numbers are _not_ part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: `114` (top right) and `58` (middle right).

Unfortunately\\u2021 digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\u2018digits\\u2019 upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist \\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each \\u2018word\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\u00a02 as well \\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n\\u2021 Citation needed.\"\n",

Your plan should be clear, detailed, and directly usable by a coding agent to implement the solution. The code should be a general solution and not just solve the test case.\\n\\n**Process:**\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 1: Understand the Problem:\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n- Carefully read and analyze the `problem_statement`, `full_description`, `underlying_concepts`, `keywords`, and `constraints`.\\n- Identify the core objective of the puzzle, the precise input format, the required output format, and any specific rules, conditions, or limitations mentioned in the constraints or description.\\n- Formulate a clear internal understanding of the problem\\'s requirements and what constitutes a correct solution.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 2: Analyze Example Solutions (if provided):\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n- If the `example_solutions` array contains entries, examine the `plan` and `code` provided for each previous puzzle.\\n- Identify common patterns, data structures, algorithms, or general problem-solving strategies that were successful in similar problems.\\n- Note how input was parsed, how logic was applied, how constraints were handled, and how the final output was generated in those examples.\\n- Evaluate which approaches or techniques from the examples might be relevant or adaptable to the current puzzle, but ensure the solution remains general and covers all possible inputs as defined in the problem description.\\n\\nNote that the given solution code might not always be in python. The plan you create will always have to be for a solution written in python.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 3: Formulate the Detailed Plan:\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUsing the deep understanding of the problem acquired in Step 1 and the relevant insights gained from analyzing example solutions (if provided) in Step 2,\\nconstruct a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan for the current Advent of Code puzzle. This plan is specifically intended for a coding agent and must be actionable and detailed enough for them to translate directly into Python code.\\n\\nFollow these instructions while formulating the plan:\\n\\n1.  **Structure the Solution:** Break the overall solution process into a sequence of distinct, logical, and modular steps.\\n2.  **Detail Each Step:** For each step you define in the plan, provide the following specific information:\\n    *   **Objective:** Clearly state the purpose of this step and what it aims to accomplish.\\n    *   **Input:** Specify what data or intermediate results this step receives or operates on.\\n    *   **Output:** Define the data structure or result this step produces for subsequent steps.\\n    *   **Techniques:** Note any specific algorithms, data structures, or core programming techniques that should be used within this step (e.g., \"Use a hash map to count frequencies\", \"Sort this list\", \"Perform a depth-first search\").\\n    *   **Constraints/Rules:** Mention how any relevant constraints, edge cases, or specific puzzle rules apply to this particular step. Ensure that the solution accounts for all possible constraints and is not limited to example inputs.\\n3.  **Cover the Full Workflow:** Ensure the sequence of steps starts with processing the initial puzzle input (if necessary) and progresses through all required calculations, transformations, and logic up to the point where the final answer is determined.\\n4.  **Modular Design:** The plan should emphasize a modular design, breaking down the problem into independent, testable components.\\n5.  **Highlight Critical Considerations:** Call out any important performance implications, tricky edge cases, or specific constraints (like memory limits or time limits, if applicable) that require careful consideration during implementation. Remind yourself that the solution must be robust and handle all valid inputs, not just the example inputs. Avoid excessive detail and focus on the essential steps required for a general solution.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 4: Generate Structured Output Format\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour final output must be *only* the structured plan, formatted using markdown.\\nDo not include any conversational text, explanations about your process, or preamble before the plan. The plan should follow this structure:\\n\\n```markdown\\n## 1. Overall Approach\\nA high-level description of the main strategy or algorithm chosen to solve the problem (e.g., \"Iterate through the input applying rules...\", \"Use dynamic programming...\", \"Represent as a graph and find shortest path...\", etc.).\\n\\n## 2. Data Structures\\nList and describe the primary data structures that will be needed (e.g., `list` to store numbers, `dictionary` for mapping, `set` for unique items, a custom `Node` class, a 2D array for a grid). Explain briefly why each is suitable.\\n\\n## 3. Detailed Steps\\nA numbered or bulleted list outlining the precise sequence of steps the coding agent should follow to implement the solution. Be specific and unambiguous.\\n\\n*   **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\\n    *   Description: How to read the input data.\\n    *   Input: Raw input string/lines.\\n    *   Output: Structured data (e.g., list of integers, grid, list of objects).\\n    *   Details: Specify format expectations and how to handle lines/sections. Consider all possible input formats and edge cases as specified in the problem description.\\n*   **Step 3.2: [Next Logical Step]**\\n    *   Description: ...\\n    *   Input: ...\\n    *   Output: ...\\n    *   Details: ...\\n*   ... continue with all necessary steps ...\\n*   **Step X: Generate Output**\\n    *   Description: Format the final result according to the puzzle\\'s output requirements.\\n    *   Input: The final calculated value(s) or structure(s).\\n    *   Output: The final string/number/formatted text.\\n    *   Details: Ensure it matches the exact format specified.\\n\\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\\nList any specific algorithms or significant techniques used across multiple steps or as a core part of the solution (e.g., Sorting, Searching (BFS/DFS), Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Regex, Specific Mathematical Formulas).\\n\\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\\nList specific conditions or constraints from the problem description that require special handling (e.g., \"Input numbers can be negative\", \"The grid might be empty\", \"Performance is critical for large inputs\", \"Handle invalid input format gracefully\"). Remind the coder to be mindful of these and to test the solution thoroughly against all edge cases.\\n\\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\\nReiterate the exact format required for the final answer (e.g., \"A single integer\", \"A string\", \"Two integers separated by a comma\").\\n\\nImportant Reminders:\\n- Focus on Generality: Ensure that your plan covers all expected inputs and edge cases.\\n- Maintain Clarity and Modularity: Structure your steps so that each is independent and contributes to a robust, maintainable solution.\\n- Leverage Examples Thoughtfully: Use previous puzzles as guidance but adapt strategies to ensure the solution is comprehensive.\\n\\n```\\n\\nYour input is:\\n{\\n  \"problem_statement\": \"Count the number of times the word \\'XMAS\\' appears in a grid of characters.

You go inside.\\\\n\\\\nIt doesn\\'t take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they\\'re not moving.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Aaah!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \\\\\"Sorry, I wasn\\'t expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn\\'t working right now; it\\'ll still be a while before I can fix it.\\\\\" You offer to help.\\\\n\\\\nThe engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can _add up all the part numbers_ in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\\\\n\\\\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don\\'t really understand, but apparently _any number adjacent to a symbol_ , even diagonally, is a \\\\\"part number\\\\\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.)\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example engine schematic:\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    467..114..\\\\n    ...*......\\\\n    ..35..633.\\\\n    ......#...\\\\n    617*......\\\\n    .....+.58.\\\\n    ..592.....\\\\n    ......755.\\\\n    ...$.*....\\\\n    .664.598..\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\nIn this schematic, two numbers are _not_ part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: `114` (top right) and `58` (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_\",\\n      \"plan\": \"1.  **Pad the Input:** Add a border of \\'.\\' characters around the entire input schematic. This simplifies boundary checks later.\\\\n2.  **Mark Adjacent Numbers:**\\\\n    *   Iterate through each symbol in the schematic.\\\\n    *   For each symbol, identify the 9 characters centered around it (including diagonals).\\\\n    *   Transform digits (0-9) to lowercase letters (a-j) to avoid case sensitivity problems.\\\\n    *   Make any \\'digits\\' in the 9-character block uppercase. This marks them as adjacent to a symbol.\\\\n3.  **Filter Non-Part Numbers:** Replace any number composed *only* of lowercase digits (i.e., not adjacent to a symbol) with \\'.\\' characters.\\\\n4.  **Calculate the Sum:**\\\\n    *   Reverse the character-value transformation (convert uppercase letters back to digits).\\\\n    *   Replace all sequences of \\'.\\' and newline characters with \\'+\\' signs.\\\\n    *   Append a \\'0\\' to the end to handle a potential trailing \\'+\\'.\\\\n    *   Evaluate the resulting expression to get the final sum.\",\\n      \"code\": {\\n        \"solution_id\": \"solution-1\",\\n        \"code\": \"\\\\u27e8Ctrl+V\\\\u27e9GI.\\\\u27e8Esc\\\\u27e9gvy$pYPVr.YGp\\\\n    :%s/\\\\\\\\d/\\\\\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))+49)/g\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9\\\\n    qaqqa/[^.a-z]\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9r.kh\\\\u27e8Ctrl+V\\\\u27e9jjllU@aq@a\\\\n    :%s/\\\\\\\\v<\\\\\\\\l+>/./g\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9vipu\\\\n    :%s/\\\\\\\\l/\\\\\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))-49)/g\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9\\\\n    :%s/\\\\\\\\v[.\\\\\\\\n]+/+/g\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9C\\\\u27e8Ctrl+R\\\\u27e9=\\\\u27e8Ctrl+R\\\\u27e9-0\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9\\\\u27e8Esc\\\\u27e9\\\\n\\\\nThe main `@a` loop\\\\u2020 on line 3 finds every symbol, visually selects the 9 characters centred on it, and makes any digits in that block upper-case, to mark them as being adjacent to a symbol.\\\\n\\\\nWait ... upper-case digits?\\\\n\\\\nFlipping the case of a character is a handy way of marking it as having been \\\\u2018found\\\\u2019 while retaining its value. Unfortunately\\\\u2021 digits don\\'t have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\\\u2018digits\\\\u2019 upper-case.\\\\n\\\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\\\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn\\'t exist \\\\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That\\'s what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can\\'t find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\\\\\v<\\\\\\\\l+>/` will match each \\\\u2018word\\\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\\\n\\\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\\\n\\\\n*Update:* Somehow I\\'ve made this work for part\\\\u00a02 as well \\\\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn\\'t make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2021 Citation needed.\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"puzzle\": \"## \\\\\\\\--- Day 5: Doesn\\'t He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---\\\\n\\\\nSanta needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.\\\\n\\\\nA _nice string_ is one with all of the following properties:\\\\n\\\\n  * It contains at least three vowels (`aeiou` only), like `aei`, `xazegov`, or `aeiouaeiouaeiou`.\\\\n  * It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like `xx`, `abcdde` (`dd`), or `aabbccdd` (`aa`, `bb`, `cc`, or `dd`).\\\\n  * It does _not_ contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\n\\\\n  * `ugknbfddgicrmopn` is nice because it has at least three vowels (`u...i...o...`), a double letter (`...dd...`), and none of the disallowed substrings.\\\\n  * `aaa` is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.\\\\n  * `jchzalrnumimnmhp` is naughty because it has no double letter.\\\\n  * `haegwjzuvuyypxyu` is naughty because it contains the string `xy`.\\\\n  * `dvszwmarrgswjxmb` is naughty because it contains only one vowel.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow many strings are nice?\",\\n      \"plan\": \"1.

Overall Approach\\\\nThe problem requires counting the number of times \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" appears in a grid in all eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and their reverses). A brute-force approach will be used, iterating through each cell in the grid and checking for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in all possible directions starting from that cell.\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Data Structures\\\\n*   `grid`: A 2D list (list of lists) to store the characters of the input grid. This allows for easy access to individual characters using row and column indices.\\\\n*   `rows`: Integer storing the number of rows in the grid.\\\\n*   `cols`: Integer storing the number of columns in the grid.\\\\n*   `count`: Integer to store the total count of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" occurrences.\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Detailed Steps\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\\\\n    *   Description: Read the input and store it in a 2D list (the grid).\\\\n    *   Input: Raw input string.\\\\n    *   Output: `grid` (list of lists of characters), `rows` (integer), `cols` (integer).\\\\n    *   Details: Split the input into lines. Each line represents a row in the grid. Convert each line into a list of characters. Store the number of rows and columns.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.2: Define Directions**\\\\n    *   Description: Define all 8 possible directions to search for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\".\\\\n    *   Input: None\\\\n    *   Output: `directions` - a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a direction (row_increment, col_increment).\\\\n    *   Details: The directions should be: (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1). These correspond to right, left, down, up, down-right, down-left, up-right, and up-left.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.3: Iterate Through the Grid**\\\\n    *   Description: Iterate through each cell in the grid.\\\\n    *   Input: `grid`, `rows`, `cols`.\\\\n    *   Output: None (this step sets up the main loop for the search).\\\\n    *   Details: Use nested loops to visit each cell (row, col) in the grid.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.4: Search in Each Direction**\\\\n    *   Description: For each cell, check for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in all 8 directions.\\\\n    *   Input: Current cell coordinates (row, col), `grid`, `directions`.\\\\n    *   Output: None (updates the `count` variable).\\\\n    *   Details: Iterate through the `directions` list. For each direction, start building a string from the current cell and check if it forms \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.5: Build String in Current Direction**\\\\n    *   Description: Starting from a given cell and direction, build a string by traversing the grid.\\\\n    *   Input: Starting cell (row, col), direction (row_increment, col_increment), `grid`.\\\\n    *   Output: A string, or None if the search goes out of bounds.\\\\n    *   Details: Initialize an empty string. Add the character at the starting cell to the string. Move to the next cell in the given direction. If the new cell is within the grid bounds, add its character to the string. Repeat this process until the string is of length 4 or the cell goes out of bounds. If at any point the cell goes out of bounds, return None.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.6: Check if String is \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\"**\\\\n    *   Description: Check if the built string is equal to \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\".\\\\n    *   Input: The string built in the previous step.\\\\n    *   Output: None (increment `count` if the string is \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\").\\\\n    *   Details: If the built string is not None and equal to \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\", increment the `count` variable.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.7: Generate Output**\\\\n    *   Description: Print the final count of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" occurrences.\\\\n    *   Input: `count`\\\\n    *   Output: The final count (an integer).\\\\n    *   Details: Print the value of the `count` variable.\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\\\\n*   **String Manipulation:** Building and comparing strings.\\\\n*   **Brute Force:** Checking every possible starting point and direction.\\\\n*   **Grid Traversal:** Moving through the grid using row and column increments.\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\\\\n*   The grid can be of any rectangular size.\\\\n*   \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" can overlap with itself or other instances of the word.\\\\n*   Ensure that the search does not go out of bounds of the grid.\\\\n\\\\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\\\\nA single integer representing the total number of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" occurrences in the grid.\"\\n}\\n'\u001b[0m\n",

Unfortunately\\u2021 digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\u2018digits\\u2019 upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist \\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each \\u2018word\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\u00a02 as well \\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n\\u2021 Citation needed.\"\n",

Your plan should be clear, detailed, and directly usable by a coding agent to implement the solution. The code should be a general solution and not just solve the test case.\\n\\n**Process:**\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 1: Understand the Problem:\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n- Carefully read and analyze the `problem_statement`, `full_description`, `underlying_concepts`, `keywords`, and `constraints`.\\n- Identify the core objective of the puzzle, the precise input format, the required output format, and any specific rules, conditions, or limitations mentioned in the constraints or description.\\n- Formulate a clear internal understanding of the problem\\'s requirements and what constitutes a correct solution.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 2: Analyze Example Solutions (if provided):\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n- If the `example_solutions` array contains entries, examine the `plan` and `code` provided for each previous puzzle.\\n- Identify common patterns, data structures, algorithms, or general problem-solving strategies that were successful in similar problems.\\n- Note how input was parsed, how logic was applied, how constraints were handled, and how the final output was generated in those examples.\\n- Evaluate which approaches or techniques from the examples might be relevant or adaptable to the current puzzle, but ensure the solution remains general and covers all possible inputs as defined in the problem description.\\n\\nNote that the given solution code might not always be in python. The plan you create will always have to be for a solution written in python.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 3: Formulate the Detailed Plan:\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUsing the deep understanding of the problem acquired in Step 1 and the relevant insights gained from analyzing example solutions (if provided) in Step 2,\\nconstruct a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan for the current Advent of Code puzzle. This plan is specifically intended for a coding agent and must be actionable and detailed enough for them to translate directly into Python code.\\n\\nFollow these instructions while formulating the plan:\\n\\n1.  **Structure the Solution:** Break the overall solution process into a sequence of distinct, logical, and modular steps.\\n2.  **Detail Each Step:** For each step you define in the plan, provide the following specific information:\\n    *   **Objective:** Clearly state the purpose of this step and what it aims to accomplish.\\n    *   **Input:** Specify what data or intermediate results this step receives or operates on.\\n    *   **Output:** Define the data structure or result this step produces for subsequent steps.\\n    *   **Techniques:** Note any specific algorithms, data structures, or core programming techniques that should be used within this step (e.g., \"Use a hash map to count frequencies\", \"Sort this list\", \"Perform a depth-first search\").\\n    *   **Constraints/Rules:** Mention how any relevant constraints, edge cases, or specific puzzle rules apply to this particular step. Ensure that the solution accounts for all possible constraints and is not limited to example inputs.\\n3.  **Cover the Full Workflow:** Ensure the sequence of steps starts with processing the initial puzzle input (if necessary) and progresses through all required calculations, transformations, and logic up to the point where the final answer is determined.\\n4.  **Modular Design:** The plan should emphasize a modular design, breaking down the problem into independent, testable components.\\n5.  **Highlight Critical Considerations:** Call out any important performance implications, tricky edge cases, or specific constraints (like memory limits or time limits, if applicable) that require careful consideration during implementation. Remind yourself that the solution must be robust and handle all valid inputs, not just the example inputs. Avoid excessive detail and focus on the essential steps required for a general solution.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 4: Generate Structured Output Format\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour final output must be *only* the structured plan, formatted using markdown.\\nDo not include any conversational text, explanations about your process, or preamble before the plan. The plan should follow this structure:\\n\\n```markdown\\n## 1. Overall Approach\\nA high-level description of the main strategy or algorithm chosen to solve the problem (e.g., \"Iterate through the input applying rules...\", \"Use dynamic programming...\", \"Represent as a graph and find shortest path...\", etc.).\\n\\n## 2. Data Structures\\nList and describe the primary data structures that will be needed (e.g., `list` to store numbers, `dictionary` for mapping, `set` for unique items, a custom `Node` class, a 2D array for a grid). Explain briefly why each is suitable.\\n\\n## 3. Detailed Steps\\nA numbered or bulleted list outlining the precise sequence of steps the coding agent should follow to implement the solution. Be specific and unambiguous.\\n\\n*   **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\\n    *   Description: How to read the input data.\\n    *   Input: Raw input string/lines.\\n    *   Output: Structured data (e.g., list of integers, grid, list of objects).\\n    *   Details: Specify format expectations and how to handle lines/sections. Consider all possible input formats and edge cases as specified in the problem description.\\n*   **Step 3.2: [Next Logical Step]**\\n    *   Description: ...\\n    *   Input: ...\\n    *   Output: ...\\n    *   Details: ...\\n*   ... continue with all necessary steps ...\\n*   **Step X: Generate Output**\\n    *   Description: Format the final result according to the puzzle\\'s output requirements.\\n    *   Input: The final calculated value(s) or structure(s).\\n    *   Output: The final string/number/formatted text.\\n    *   Details: Ensure it matches the exact format specified.\\n\\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\\nList any specific algorithms or significant techniques used across multiple steps or as a core part of the solution (e.g., Sorting, Searching (BFS/DFS), Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Regex, Specific Mathematical Formulas).\\n\\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\\nList specific conditions or constraints from the problem description that require special handling (e.g., \"Input numbers can be negative\", \"The grid might be empty\", \"Performance is critical for large inputs\", \"Handle invalid input format gracefully\"). Remind the coder to be mindful of these and to test the solution thoroughly against all edge cases.\\n\\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\\nReiterate the exact format required for the final answer (e.g., \"A single integer\", \"A string\", \"Two integers separated by a comma\").\\n\\nImportant Reminders:\\n- Focus on Generality: Ensure that your plan covers all expected inputs and edge cases.\\n- Maintain Clarity and Modularity: Structure your steps so that each is independent and contributes to a robust, maintainable solution.\\n- Leverage Examples Thoughtfully: Use previous puzzles as guidance but adapt strategies to ensure the solution is comprehensive.\\n\\n```\\n\\nYour input is:\\n{\\n  \"problem_statement\": \"Count the number of times the word \\'XMAS\\' appears in a grid of characters.

Unfortunately\\\\u2021 digits don\\'t have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\\\u2018digits\\\\u2019 upper-case.\\\\n\\\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\\\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn\\'t exist \\\\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That\\'s what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can\\'t find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\\\\\v<\\\\\\\\l+>/` will match each \\\\u2018word\\\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\\\n\\\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\\\n\\\\n*Update:* Somehow I\\'ve made this work for part\\\\u00a02 as well \\\\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn\\'t make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2021 Citation needed.\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"puzzle\": \"## \\\\\\\\--- Day 5: Doesn\\'t He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---\\\\n\\\\nSanta needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.\\\\n\\\\nA _nice string_ is one with all of the following properties:\\\\n\\\\n  * It contains at least three vowels (`aeiou` only), like `aei`, `xazegov`, or `aeiouaeiouaeiou`.\\\\n  * It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like `xx`, `abcdde` (`dd`), or `aabbccdd` (`aa`, `bb`, `cc`, or `dd`).\\\\n  * It does _not_ contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\n\\\\n  * `ugknbfddgicrmopn` is nice because it has at least three vowels (`u...i...o...`), a double letter (`...dd...`), and none of the disallowed substrings.\\\\n  * `aaa` is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.\\\\n  * `jchzalrnumimnmhp` is naughty because it has no double letter.\\\\n  * `haegwjzuvuyypxyu` is naughty because it contains the string `xy`.\\\\n  * `dvszwmarrgswjxmb` is naughty because it contains only one vowel.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow many strings are nice?\",\\n      \"plan\": \"1.

A brute-force approach is suitable: iterate through each cell in the grid and check for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in all eight directions originating from that cell.\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Data Structures\\\\n*   `grid`: A 2D list (list of lists) of characters representing the word search grid. This allows easy access to individual characters using row and column indices.\\\\n*   `rows`: Integer to store the number of rows in the grid.\\\\n*   `cols`: Integer to store the number of columns in the grid.\\\\n*   `count`: Integer to store the number of occurrences of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Detailed Steps\\\\n*   **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\\\\n    *   Description: Read the input, line by line, and store it in a 2D list representing the grid.\\\\n    *   Input: Raw input string.\\\\n    *   Output: `grid` (2D list of characters), `rows`, and `cols`.\\\\n    *   Details: Split the input into lines. Each line is a row in the grid. Each character in the line is an element in the row. Store the number of rows and columns.\\\\n*   **Step 3.2: Initialize Variables**\\\\n    *   Description: Initialize the variables `rows`, `cols`, and `count`.\\\\n    *   Input: `grid`\\\\n    *   Output: `rows`, `cols`, `count`.\\\\n    *   Details: Set `rows` to the number of rows in `grid`, `cols` to the number of columns in the first row in `grid`, and `count` to 0.\\\\n*   **Step 3.3: Iterate Through the Grid**\\\\n    *   Description: Iterate through each cell in the grid, using nested loops for row and column indices.\\\\n    *   Input: `grid`, `rows`, `cols`.\\\\n    *   Output: None (the loop iterates through all cells).\\\\n    *   Details: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the rows (0 to `rows`-1) and a nested `for` loop to iterate through the columns (0 to `cols`-1).\\\\n*   **Step 3.4: Check for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in All Directions**\\\\n    *   Description: For each cell, check for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in all eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and their reverses).\\\\n    *   Input: `grid`, current row index (`r`), current column index (`c`).\\\\n    *   Output: None (updates the `count` variable).\\\\n    *   Details: Create a helper function `check_direction(grid, r, c, dr, dc)` that checks if \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" exists starting from `grid[r][c]` in the direction defined by `dr` (row increment) and `dc` (column increment). `dr` and `dc` can be -1, 0, or 1.\\\\n    *   Call `check_direction` eight times, with the following (dr, dc) values: (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1). These correspond to right, left, down, up, down-right, down-left, up-right, and up-left directions, respectively.\\\\n*   **Step 3.5: `check_direction` Function**\\\\n    *   Description: Checks if the word \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" exists in the given direction from the starting cell.\\\\n    *   Input: `grid`, starting row index (`r`), starting column index (`c`), row increment (`dr`), column increment (`dc`).\\\\n    *   Output: None (increments `count` if \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" is found).\\\\n    *   Details:\\\\n        *   Initialize `word` to an empty string.\\\\n        *   Iterate four times (the length of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\").\\\\n        *   In each iteration, check if the current cell is within the grid boundaries. If not, return immediately.\\\\n        *   Append the character at `grid[r][c]` to `word`.\\\\n        *   Update `r` and `c` by adding `dr` and `dc` respectively.\\\\n        *   After the loop, check if `word` is equal to \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\". If it is, increment `count`.\\\\n*   **Step 3.6: Check for Reversed \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in All Directions**\\\\n    *   Description: Very similar to step 3.4 but instead of checking directly for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\", check for the reversed string \\\\\"SAMX\\\\\".\\\\n    *   Input: `grid`, current row index (`r`), current column index (`c`).\\\\n    *   Output: None (updates the `count` variable).\\\\n    *   Details: Create a helper function `check_direction(grid, r, c, dr, dc)` that checks if \\\\\"SAMX\\\\\" exists starting from `grid[r][c]` in the direction defined by `dr` (row increment) and `dc` (column increment). `dr` and `dc` can be -1, 0, or 1.\\\\n    *   Call `check_direction` eight times, with the following (dr, dc) values: (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1). These correspond to right, left, down, up, down-right, down-left, up-right, and up-left directions, respectively.\\\\n*   **Step 3.7: Generate Output**\\\\n    *   Description: Print the final count of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" occurrences.\\\\n    *   Input: `count`.\\\\n    *   Output: The integer value of `count`.\\\\n    *   Details: Print the value of `count`.\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\\\\n*   Brute Force: Iterating through every cell and checking in all possible directions.\\\\n*   String Comparison: Comparing the extracted string with \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\".\\\\n*   Grid Traversal: Incrementing row and column indices based on direction vectors.\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\\\\n*   Grid Boundaries: Ensure that the search for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" doesn\\'t go out of bounds of the grid. This is handled in the `check_direction` function.\\\\n*   Empty Grid: Handle the case where the input grid is empty.  The code should still function correctly (return 0).\\\\n*   Rectangular Grid: The code should work correctly for rectangular grids (rows and columns don\\'t have to be equal).\\\\n*   Overlapping occurrences: the code should correctly count overlapping occurrences as separate occurrences.\\\\n\\\\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\\\\nA single integer representing the total number of times \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" appears in the grid in any direction.\"\\n}\\n'\u001b[0m\n",

Unfortunately\\u2021 digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\u2018digits\\u2019 upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist \\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each \\u2018word\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\u00a02 as well \\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n\\u2021 Citation needed.\"\n",

Your plan should be clear, detailed, and directly usable by a coding agent to implement the solution. The code should be a general solution and not just solve the test case.\\n\\n**Process:**\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 1: Understand the Problem:\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n- Carefully read and analyze the `problem_statement`, `full_description`, `underlying_concepts`, `keywords`, and `constraints`.\\n- Identify the core objective of the puzzle, the precise input format, the required output format, and any specific rules, conditions, or limitations mentioned in the constraints or description.\\n- Formulate a clear internal understanding of the problem\\'s requirements and what constitutes a correct solution.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 2: Analyze Example Solutions (if provided):\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n- If the `example_solutions` array contains entries, examine the `plan` and `code` provided for each previous puzzle.\\n- Identify common patterns, data structures, algorithms, or general problem-solving strategies that were successful in similar problems.\\n- Note how input was parsed, how logic was applied, how constraints were handled, and how the final output was generated in those examples.\\n- Evaluate which approaches or techniques from the examples might be relevant or adaptable to the current puzzle, but ensure the solution remains general and covers all possible inputs as defined in the problem description.\\n\\nNote that the given solution code might not always be in python. The plan you create will always have to be for a solution written in python.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 3: Formulate the Detailed Plan:\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUsing the deep understanding of the problem acquired in Step 1 and the relevant insights gained from analyzing example solutions (if provided) in Step 2,\\nconstruct a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan for the current Advent of Code puzzle. This plan is specifically intended for a coding agent and must be actionable and detailed enough for them to translate directly into Python code.\\n\\nFollow these instructions while formulating the plan:\\n\\n1.  **Structure the Solution:** Break the overall solution process into a sequence of distinct, logical, and modular steps.\\n2.  **Detail Each Step:** For each step you define in the plan, provide the following specific information:\\n    *   **Objective:** Clearly state the purpose of this step and what it aims to accomplish.\\n    *   **Input:** Specify what data or intermediate results this step receives or operates on.\\n    *   **Output:** Define the data structure or result this step produces for subsequent steps.\\n    *   **Techniques:** Note any specific algorithms, data structures, or core programming techniques that should be used within this step (e.g., \"Use a hash map to count frequencies\", \"Sort this list\", \"Perform a depth-first search\").\\n    *   **Constraints/Rules:** Mention how any relevant constraints, edge cases, or specific puzzle rules apply to this particular step. Ensure that the solution accounts for all possible constraints and is not limited to example inputs.\\n3.  **Cover the Full Workflow:** Ensure the sequence of steps starts with processing the initial puzzle input (if necessary) and progresses through all required calculations, transformations, and logic up to the point where the final answer is determined.\\n4.  **Modular Design:** The plan should emphasize a modular design, breaking down the problem into independent, testable components.\\n5.  **Highlight Critical Considerations:** Call out any important performance implications, tricky edge cases, or specific constraints (like memory limits or time limits, if applicable) that require careful consideration during implementation. Remind yourself that the solution must be robust and handle all valid inputs, not just the example inputs. Avoid excessive detail and focus on the essential steps required for a general solution.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nStep 4: Generate Structured Output Format\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYour final output must be *only* the structured plan, formatted using markdown.\\nDo not include any conversational text, explanations about your process, or preamble before the plan. The plan should follow this structure:\\n\\n```markdown\\n## 1. Overall Approach\\nA high-level description of the main strategy or algorithm chosen to solve the problem (e.g., \"Iterate through the input applying rules...\", \"Use dynamic programming...\", \"Represent as a graph and find shortest path...\", etc.).\\n\\n## 2. Data Structures\\nList and describe the primary data structures that will be needed (e.g., `list` to store numbers, `dictionary` for mapping, `set` for unique items, a custom `Node` class, a 2D array for a grid). Explain briefly why each is suitable.\\n\\n## 3. Detailed Steps\\nA numbered or bulleted list outlining the precise sequence of steps the coding agent should follow to implement the solution. Be specific and unambiguous.\\n\\n*   **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\\n    *   Description: How to read the input data.\\n    *   Input: Raw input string/lines.\\n    *   Output: Structured data (e.g., list of integers, grid, list of objects).\\n    *   Details: Specify format expectations and how to handle lines/sections. Consider all possible input formats and edge cases as specified in the problem description.\\n*   **Step 3.2: [Next Logical Step]**\\n    *   Description: ...\\n    *   Input: ...\\n    *   Output: ...\\n    *   Details: ...\\n*   ... continue with all necessary steps ...\\n*   **Step X: Generate Output**\\n    *   Description: Format the final result according to the puzzle\\'s output requirements.\\n    *   Input: The final calculated value(s) or structure(s).\\n    *   Output: The final string/number/formatted text.\\n    *   Details: Ensure it matches the exact format specified.\\n\\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\\nList any specific algorithms or significant techniques used across multiple steps or as a core part of the solution (e.g., Sorting, Searching (BFS/DFS), Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Regex, Specific Mathematical Formulas).\\n\\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\\nList specific conditions or constraints from the problem description that require special handling (e.g., \"Input numbers can be negative\", \"The grid might be empty\", \"Performance is critical for large inputs\", \"Handle invalid input format gracefully\"). Remind the coder to be mindful of these and to test the solution thoroughly against all edge cases.\\n\\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\\nReiterate the exact format required for the final answer (e.g., \"A single integer\", \"A string\", \"Two integers separated by a comma\").\\n\\nImportant Reminders:\\n- Focus on Generality: Ensure that your plan covers all expected inputs and edge cases.\\n- Maintain Clarity and Modularity: Structure your steps so that each is independent and contributes to a robust, maintainable solution.\\n- Leverage Examples Thoughtfully: Use previous puzzles as guidance but adapt strategies to ensure the solution is comprehensive.\\n\\n```\\n\\nYour input is:\\n{\\n  \"problem_statement\": \"Count the number of times the word \\'XMAS\\' appears in a grid of characters.

Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_\",\\n      \"plan\": \"1.  **Pad the Input:** Add a border of \\'.\\' characters around the entire input schematic. This simplifies boundary checks later.\\\\n2.  **Mark Adjacent Numbers:**\\\\n    *   Iterate through each symbol in the schematic.\\\\n    *   For each symbol, identify the 9 characters centered around it (including diagonals).\\\\n    *   Transform digits (0-9) to lowercase letters (a-j) to avoid case sensitivity problems.\\\\n    *   Make any \\'digits\\' in the 9-character block uppercase. This marks them as adjacent to a symbol.\\\\n3.  **Filter Non-Part Numbers:** Replace any number composed *only* of lowercase digits (i.e., not adjacent to a symbol) with \\'.\\' characters.\\\\n4.  **Calculate the Sum:**\\\\n    *   Reverse the character-value transformation (convert uppercase letters back to digits).\\\\n    *   Replace all sequences of \\'.\\' and newline characters with \\'+\\' signs.\\\\n    *   Append a \\'0\\' to the end to handle a potential trailing \\'+\\'.\\\\n    *   Evaluate the resulting expression to get the final sum.\",\\n      \"code\": {\\n        \"solution_id\": \"solution-1\",\\n        \"code\": \"\\\\u27e8Ctrl+V\\\\u27e9GI.\\\\u27e8Esc\\\\u27e9gvy$pYPVr.YGp\\\\n    :%s/\\\\\\\\d/\\\\\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))+49)/g\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9\\\\n    qaqqa/[^.a-z]\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9r.kh\\\\u27e8Ctrl+V\\\\u27e9jjllU@aq@a\\\\n    :%s/\\\\\\\\v<\\\\\\\\l+>/./g\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9vipu\\\\n    :%s/\\\\\\\\l/\\\\\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))-49)/g\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9\\\\n    :%s/\\\\\\\\v[.\\\\\\\\n]+/+/g\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9C\\\\u27e8Ctrl+R\\\\u27e9=\\\\u27e8Ctrl+R\\\\u27e9-0\\\\u27e8Enter\\\\u27e9\\\\u27e8Esc\\\\u27e9\\\\n\\\\nThe main `@a` loop\\\\u2020 on line 3 finds every symbol, visually selects the 9 characters centred on it, and makes any digits in that block upper-case, to mark them as being adjacent to a symbol.\\\\n\\\\nWait ... upper-case digits?\\\\n\\\\nFlipping the case of a character is a handy way of marking it as having been \\\\u2018found\\\\u2019 while retaining its value. Unfortunately\\\\u2021 digits don\\'t have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\\\u2018digits\\\\u2019 upper-case.\\\\n\\\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\\\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn\\'t exist \\\\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That\\'s what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can\\'t find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\\\\\v<\\\\\\\\l+>/` will match each \\\\u2018word\\\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\\\n\\\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\\\n\\\\n*Update:* Somehow I\\'ve made this work for part\\\\u00a02 as well \\\\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn\\'t make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2021 Citation needed.\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"puzzle\": \"## \\\\\\\\--- Day 5: Doesn\\'t He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---\\\\n\\\\nSanta needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.\\\\n\\\\nA _nice string_ is one with all of the following properties:\\\\n\\\\n  * It contains at least three vowels (`aeiou` only), like `aei`, `xazegov`, or `aeiouaeiouaeiou`.\\\\n  * It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like `xx`, `abcdde` (`dd`), or `aabbccdd` (`aa`, `bb`, `cc`, or `dd`).\\\\n  * It does _not_ contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\n\\\\n  * `ugknbfddgicrmopn` is nice because it has at least three vowels (`u...i...o...`), a double letter (`...dd...`), and none of the disallowed substrings.\\\\n  * `aaa` is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.\\\\n  * `jchzalrnumimnmhp` is naughty because it has no double letter.\\\\n  * `haegwjzuvuyypxyu` is naughty because it contains the string `xy`.\\\\n  * `dvszwmarrgswjxmb` is naughty because it contains only one vowel.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow many strings are nice?\",\\n      \"plan\": \"1.

Overall Approach\\\\nThe problem requires counting the number of occurrences of the word \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in a grid, considering all eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and their reverses). A brute-force approach will be used, iterating through each cell of the grid and checking for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in all possible directions starting from that cell.\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Data Structures\\\\n*   `grid`: A 2D list (list of lists) to store the grid of characters. This allows easy access to individual characters using row and column indices.\\\\n*   `rows`: integer representing the number of rows\\\\n*   `cols`: integer representing the number of columns\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Detailed Steps\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\\\\n    *   Description: Read the input and store it as a 2D list (grid) of characters.\\\\n    *   Input: The raw input string.\\\\n    *   Output: A 2D list representing the grid.\\\\n    *   Details: Split the input into lines. Each line becomes a row in the grid. Each character in the line becomes an element in the row. Determine `rows` and `cols` to use later in loops.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.2: Define Directions**\\\\n    *   Description: Define all possible directions to search for the word XMAS.\\\\n    *   Input: None.\\\\n    *   Output: A list of tuples representing the directions.\\\\n    *   Details: The directions should be represented as (row_increment, col_increment) tuples. The possible directions are:\\\\n        *   (0, 1)  - Right\\\\n        *   (0, -1) - Left\\\\n        *   (1, 0)  - Down\\\\n        *   (-1, 0) - Up\\\\n        *   (1, 1)  - Down-Right\\\\n        *   (1, -1) - Down-Left\\\\n        *   (-1, 1) - Up-Right\\\\n        *   (-1, -1)- Up-Left\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.3: Search for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\"**\\\\n    *   Description: Iterate through each cell of the grid and check for the presence of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in all directions starting from that cell.\\\\n    *   Input: The grid (2D list) and the list of directions.\\\\n    *   Output: The total count of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" occurrences.\\\\n    *   Details:\\\\n        *   Initialize a counter `count` to 0.\\\\n        *   Iterate through each cell (row, col) in the grid.\\\\n        *   For each cell, iterate through all the defined directions.\\\\n        *   For each direction, attempt to find \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" starting from the current cell and moving in that direction.  Call a helper function `check_direction` that takes grid, row, col, and direction as input.\\\\n        *   Add the number of occurrences found in that direction to the total `count`.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.4: Implement `check_direction` Function**\\\\n    *   Description: Checks for \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" in a specific direction from a given starting cell.\\\\n    *   Input: The grid, the starting row, the starting column, and the direction (row_increment, col_increment).\\\\n    *   Output: 1 if XMAS is found, 0 otherwise.\\\\n    *   Details:\\\\n        *   Initialize an empty string `word`.\\\\n        *   Starting from the given cell (row, col), move in the specified direction, adding each character to the `word` string.\\\\n        *   Stop adding characters when:\\\\n            *   The row or column index goes out of bounds of the grid.\\\\n            *   The length of the `word` string becomes equal to 4 (the length of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\").\\\\n        *   After building the word, check if it is equal to \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\". Also, check if it is equal to \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" reversed (\\\\\"SAMX\\\\\"). Return 1 if either is true, otherwise return 0.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\\\\n    *   Description: Print the final count of \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" occurrences.\\\\n    *   Input: The final count.\\\\n    *   Output: The final string (the integer count).\\\\n    *   Details: Return the integer representing the total number of times \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" appears in the grid.\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\\\\n*   Brute-force string searching\\\\n*   Grid traversal\\\\n*   String reversal\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\\\\n*   The input grid can be empty. If empty, the output should be 0.\\\\n*   The input grid can contain rows of different lengths. The code should handle this gracefully, potentially by only considering the minimum row length. However, the problem states that the input is a rectangular grid, so this condition does not need to be handled.\\\\n*   The code should be case-sensitive and only count \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\", not \\\\\"xmas\\\\\" or other variations.\\\\n*   Overlapping occurrences must be counted separately.\\\\n\\\\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\\\\nA single integer representing the total number of times the word \\\\\"XMAS\\\\\" appears in the grid.\"\\n}\\n'\u001b[0m\n",

You go inside.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they\\'re not moving.\\n\\n\"Aaah!\"\\n\\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \"Sorry, I wasn\\'t expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn\\'t working right now; it\\'ll still be a while before I can fix it.\" You offer to help.\\n\\nThe engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can _add up all the part numbers_ in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\\n\\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don\\'t really understand, but apparently _any number adjacent to a symbol_ , even diagonally, is a \"part number\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.)\\n\\nHere is an example engine schematic:\\n    \\n    \\n    467..114..\\n    ...*......\\n    ..35..633.\\n    ......#...\\n    617*......\\n    .....+.58.\\n    ..592.....\\n    ......755.\\n    ...$.*....\\n    .664.598..\\n    \\n\\nIn this schematic, two numbers are _not_ part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: `114` (top right) and `58` (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\n\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_', solution={'solution_id': 'solution-1', 'code': \"⟨Ctrl+V⟩GI.⟨Esc⟩gvy$pYPVr.YGp\\n    :%s/\\\\d/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))+49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    qaqqa/[^.a-z]⟨Enter⟩r.kh⟨Ctrl+V⟩jjllU@aq@a\\n    :%s/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/./g⟨Enter⟩vipu\\n    :%s/\\\\l/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))-49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    :%s/\\\\v[.\\\\n]+/+/g⟨Enter⟩C⟨Ctrl+R⟩=⟨Ctrl+R⟩-0⟨Enter⟩⟨Esc⟩\\n\\nThe main `@a` loop† on line 3 finds every symbol, visually selects the 9 characters centred on it, and makes any digits in that block upper-case, to mark them as being adjacent to a symbol.\\n\\nWait ... upper-case digits?\\n\\nFlipping the case of a character is a handy way of marking it as having been ‘found’ while retaining its value. Unfortunately‡ digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the ‘digits’ upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges — which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist — first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each ‘word’ still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\xa02 as well — see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n† What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n‡ Citation needed.\"}, year=2023, day=3),\n",

Also, check if it is equal to \"XMAS\" reversed (\"SAMX\"). Return 1 if either is true, otherwise return 0.\\n\\n*   **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\\n    *   Description: Print the final count of \"XMAS\" occurrences.\\n    *   Input: The final count.\\n    *   Output: The final string (the integer count).\\n    *   Details: Return the integer representing the total number of times \"XMAS\" appears in the grid.\\n\\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\\n*   Brute-force string searching\\n*   Grid traversal\\n*   String reversal\\n\\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\\n*   The input grid can be empty. If empty, the output should be 0.\\n*   The input grid can contain rows of different lengths. The code should handle this gracefully, potentially by only considering the minimum row length. However, the problem states that the input is a rectangular grid, so this condition does not need to be handled.\\n*   The code should be case-sensitive and only count \"XMAS\", not \"xmas\" or other variations.\\n*   Overlapping occurrences must be counted separately.\\n\\n## 6.

All you need to do is identify the questions for which _anyone in your group_ answers \"yes\". Since your group is just you, this doesn\\'t take very long.\\n\\nHowever, the person sitting next to you seems to be experiencing a language barrier and asks if you can help.

You go inside.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they\\'re not moving.\\n\\n\"Aaah!\"\\n\\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \"Sorry, I wasn\\'t expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn\\'t working right now; it\\'ll still be a while before I can fix it.\" You offer to help.\\n\\nThe engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can _add up all the part numbers_ in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\\n\\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don\\'t really understand, but apparently _any number adjacent to a symbol_ , even diagonally, is a \"part number\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.)\\n\\nHere is an example engine schematic:\\n    \\n    \\n    467..114..\\n    ...*......\\n    ..35..633.\\n    ......#...\\n    617*......\\n    .....+.58.\\n    ..592.....\\n    ......755.\\n    ...$.*....\\n    .664.598..\\n    \\n\\nIn this schematic, two numbers are _not_ part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: `114` (top right) and `58` (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so _is_ a part number; their sum is `_4361_`.\\n\\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. _What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?_', solution={'solution_id': 'solution-1', 'code': \"⟨Ctrl+V⟩GI.⟨Esc⟩gvy$pYPVr.YGp\\n    :%s/\\\\d/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))+49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    qaqqa/[^.a-z]⟨Enter⟩r.kh⟨Ctrl+V⟩jjllU@aq@a\\n    :%s/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/./g⟨Enter⟩vipu\\n    :%s/\\\\l/\\\\=nr2char(char2nr(submatch(0))-49)/g⟨Enter⟩\\n    :%s/\\\\v[.\\\\n]+/+/g⟨Enter⟩C⟨Ctrl+R⟩=⟨Ctrl+R⟩-0⟨Enter⟩⟨Esc⟩\\n\\nThe main `@a` loop† on line 3 finds every symbol, visually selects the 9 characters centred on it, and makes any digits in that block upper-case, to mark them as being adjacent to a symbol.\\n\\nWait ... upper-case digits?\\n\\nFlipping the case of a character is a handy way of marking it as having been ‘found’ while retaining its value. Unfortunately‡ digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the ‘digits’ upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges — which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist — first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each ‘word’ still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\xa02 as well — see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n† What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n‡ Citation needed.\"}, year=2023, day=3),\n",

Unfortunately\\u2021 digits don't have case. So `0-9` is first transformed into `a-j`, by that substitution that adds `49` to its character value. *Then* we can make the \\u2018digits\\u2019 upper-case.\\n\\nAnd to avoid having to handle the literal edge-cases of symbols near edges \\u2014 which would mess up drawing the visual block, because some of the 8 characters surrounding them wouldn't exist \\u2014 first add extra padding of a `.` to all 4 sides of the input. That's what the top line does: adds dots down the left, copies them to the right, then duplicates the top line, makes the new top all dots, and copies that to the bottom.\\n\\nOnce the loop ends (because the `/` can't find any more symbols; each matched symbol is also turned into a `.` so it only gets processed once), any number adjacent to a symbol will have at least one upper-case digit in it. `/\\\\v<\\\\l+>/` will match each \\u2018word\\u2019 still composed only of lower-case digits, and replacing each of those with an innocuous `.` means all remaining numbers are indeed part numbers.\\n\\nSo reverse the character-value transformation, by making all the remaining digits lower-case again and subtracting `49`, to turn the letters back into more conventional-looking digits. Then replace each bit between the numbers (any string of one or more `.` or line-break characters) with a `+` sign to create a sum of them, and use the expression-evaluation design pattern from earlier days to get the answer. The only variation is appending an extra `0` to the expression because substitution will have left a final `+` at the end of the line, which would be a syntax error; turning it into `+0` makes it valid without changing the result.\\n\\n*Update:* Somehow I've made this work for part\\u00a02 as well \\u2014 see this [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kbskr4l/?context=3).\\n\\n\\u2020 What do you mean it doesn't make sense for a bunch of keystrokes to have such a program-centric concept as a main loop?\\n\\n\\u2021 Citation needed.\"\n",

Overall Approach\\nThe problem requires counting the number of occurrences of the word \\\"XMAS\\\" in a grid, considering all eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and their reverses). A brute-force approach will be used, iterating through each cell of the grid and checking for \\\"XMAS\\\" in all possible directions starting from that cell.\\n\\n## 2. Data Structures\\n*   `grid`: A 2D list (list of lists) to store the grid of characters. This allows easy access to individual characters using row and column indices.\\n*   `rows`: integer representing the number of rows\\n*   `cols`: integer representing the number of columns\\n\\n## 3. Detailed Steps\\n\\n*   **Step 3.1: Input Parsing**\\n    *   Description: Read the input and store it as a 2D list (grid) of characters.\\n    *   Input: The raw input string.\\n    *   Output: A 2D list representing the grid.\\n    *   Details: Split the input into lines. Each line becomes a row in the grid. Each character in the line becomes an element in the row. Determine `rows` and `cols` to use later in loops.\\n\\n*   **Step 3.2: Define Directions**\\n    *   Description: Define all possible directions to search for the word XMAS.\\n    *   Input: None.\\n    *   Output: A list of tuples representing the directions.\\n    *   Details: The directions should be represented as (row_increment, col_increment) tuples. The possible directions are:\\n        *   (0, 1)  - Right\\n        *   (0, -1) - Left\\n        *   (1, 0)  - Down\\n        *   (-1, 0) - Up\\n        *   (1, 1)  - Down-Right\\n        *   (1, -1) - Down-Left\\n        *   (-1, 1) - Up-Right\\n        *   (-1, -1)- Up-Left\\n\\n*   **Step 3.3: Search for \\\"XMAS\\\"**\\n    *   Description: Iterate through each cell of the grid and check for the presence of \\\"XMAS\\\" in all directions starting from that cell.\\n    *   Input: The grid (2D list) and the list of directions.\\n    *   Output: The total count of \\\"XMAS\\\" occurrences.\\n    *   Details:\\n        *   Initialize a counter `count` to 0.\\n        *   Iterate through each cell (row, col) in the grid.\\n        *   For each cell, iterate through all the defined directions.\\n        *   For each direction, attempt to find \\\"XMAS\\\" starting from the current cell and moving in that direction.  Call a helper function `check_direction` that takes grid, row, col, and direction as input.\\n        *   Add the number of occurrences found in that direction to the total `count`.\\n\\n*   **Step 3.4: Implement `check_direction` Function**\\n    *   Description: Checks for \\\"XMAS\\\" in a specific direction from a given starting cell.\\n    *   Input: The grid, the starting row, the starting column, and the direction (row_increment, col_increment).\\n    *   Output: 1 if XMAS is found, 0 otherwise.\\n    *   Details:\\n        *   Initialize an empty string `word`.\\n        *   Starting from the given cell (row, col), move in the specified direction, adding each character to the `word` string.\\n        *   Stop adding characters when:\\n            *   The row or column index goes out of bounds of the grid.\\n            *   The length of the `word` string becomes equal to 4 (the length of \\\"XMAS\\\").\\n        *   After building the word, check if it is equal to \\\"XMAS\\\". Also, check if it is equal to \\\"XMAS\\\" reversed (\\\"SAMX\\\"). Return 1 if either is true, otherwise return 0.\\n\\n*   **Step 3.5: Generate Output**\\n    *   Description: Print the final count of \\\"XMAS\\\" occurrences.\\n    *   Input: The final count.\\n    *   Output: The final string (the integer count).\\n    *   Details: Return the integer representing the total number of times \\\"XMAS\\\" appears in the grid.\\n\\n## 4. Algorithms/Techniques\\n*   Brute-force string searching\\n*   Grid traversal\\n*   String reversal\\n\\n## 5. Edge Cases and Constraints\\n*   The input grid can be empty. If empty, the output should be 0.\\n*   The input grid can contain rows of different lengths. The code should handle this gracefully, potentially by only considering the minimum row length. However, the problem states that the input is a rectangular grid, so this condition does not need to be handled.\\n*   The code should be case-sensitive and only count \\\"XMAS\\\", not \\\"xmas\\\" or other variations.\\n*   Overlapping occurrences must be counted separately.\\n\\n## 6. Expected Final Output Format\\nA single integer representing the total number of times the word \\\"XMAS\\\" appears in the grid.\",\n",
